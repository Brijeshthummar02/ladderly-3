## The Job Search Tool

Measurement on the job search is crucial to ensure continued performance improvements. Did you know that [measurement alone can cause improvement in outcomes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7607506)? This effect is known as the observer effect, [reflexive measurement](https://philarchive.org/archive/MICRM-4), or measurement as intervention. In addition, a measurement tool allows you to A/B test changes in your job search strategy and see whether those changes are causing improved performance.

Guests can access a [spreadsheet template](/blog/2024-02-12-resume-optimization#job-search-spreadsheet-tools) for application tracking, but premium members get access to a full-blown tool with data visualization features, automated bottleneck diagnosis, and built-in AI assistance coming soon!

## Career Journaling

Track your accomplishments at work or off the job, then use an AI assistant to automatically draft notes into powerful stories of impact that can be used during performance review time, behavioral interviews, and more!

Did you know that [journaling is a powerful tool for mental health](https://positivepsychology.com/benefits-of-journaling/)? In addition to acting as a brag book and AI accountability partner, the journaling tool can also be used to track pain points, accomplishments, and insights related to your personal life, helping ensure progress toward your long-term goals and wellbeing.
