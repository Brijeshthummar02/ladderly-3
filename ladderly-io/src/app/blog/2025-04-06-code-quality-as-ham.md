title: 'Quality Software as a CUTE TYPE HAM'
author: John Vandivier
---

Ladderly.io is a platform for programming education, so it's fitting that we lay out some principles for code quality, system design, and the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

Ladderly.io's `CUTE TYPE HAM` mnemonic for quality software:

1. Includes some other well-known mnemonics
2. Specifically contrasts to some other approaches to clean code
3. Applies beyond the code to system design, process, and organizational concerns
4. Includes positive examples and antipattern examples to concretize the mnemonic

## The CUTE TYPE HAM Table

| Letter | Expansion | Brief Explanation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **C** | **C**UPID | Follows [the CUPID principles for joyful coding](https://dannorth.net/cupid-for-joyful-coding/)  |
| **U** | **U**nderstandable | Intuitive and readable. Readability includes documentation. |
| **T** | **T**ested | Your code should be tested. This doesn't imply pure TDD. |
| **E** | **E**nvironment‑agnostic | Environmental parity, hermetic builds, and local autonomy |
| **T** | **T**yped | Types improve code quality. |
| **Y** | **Y**AGNI | Only build what you need now or near-term. |
| **P** | **P**ragmatic | Prioritize outcomes over principles. |
| **E** | **E**xplicit over implicit | Write out your low-level logic instead of using magic. |
| **H** | **H**uman‑centred | Emphasize DX and UX. Use BDD. |
| **A** | **A**utomated | Quality should be automatically implemented and verified. |
| **M** | **M**onitored | System behavior and issues should be highly visible. |

## Why Another Acronym?

1. **Memory is finite.** A single phrase beats a grocery list of principles.  
2. **Shared language matters.** “Does this PR pass the CUTE TYPE HAM test?” is a lightweight gate‑check everyone understands.  
3. **Coverage with concision.** The acronym is short, but each letter expands into a concrete, actionable guideline.

## The Letters in Depth

### C — Composable  

Borrowed from [CUPID](https://principles.dev/), composability pushes us toward functions and modules that do *one* thing and chain together cleanly. It’s the antidote to “god objects” and tangled dependency graphs.

### U — Understandable  

Code is read far more than it’s written. Make it intuitive through clear naming, straightforward control flow, and *living documentation* (diagrams, ADRs, README snippets). If a new hire can’t reason about it in 15 minutes, refactor or clarify.

### T — Tested  

Unit, integration, property‑based, contract—pick the mix that gives you confidence. Remember the **Rule of Three**: if you’ve copied a block twice, test the abstraction before you extract it.

### E — Environment‑agnostic  

*Hermetic builds* (lockfiles, containerised tool‑chains) + *runtime parity* (12‑Factor config) + *local agnosticism* (no “install Homebrew 4.9 first” in your README). If it passes in CI, it should pass on every laptop.

### T — Typed  

Whether you’re in TypeScript, Rust, Kotlin, or adding `typing` to Python, make illegal states unrepresentable. Bonus: typed error envelopes (`Result<T,E>`, `Either`, sealed classes) let failures *scream* in the type system.

### Y — YAGNI  

Features, abstractions, and micro‑optimisations that don’t solve a problem today are weight you carry tomorrow. Keep the backpack light.

### P — Pragmatic  

Prefer shipping to polishing. Choose stable libs over the shiny release‑candidate. Optimise when profiling data—not hunches—says it’s worth it.

### E — Explicit over implicit  

No hidden magic. Favour configuration files checked into VCS over wikis. Name your side‑effects (`saveAndPublish`, `retryingFetch`) so readers know what’s at stake.

### H — Human‑centred  

Good software respects *all* its humans: maintainers, stakeholders, and end‑users. BDD scenarios capture stakeholder intent; clear error messages and accessible UIs respect consumers; tidy repos and helpful docs respect contributors.

### A — Automated  

*Machines do repetitive work better than humans.* Run formatters and linters pre‑commit, spin test suites in CI, deploy via pipelines, migrate schemas on release. A green pipeline is your licence to merge.

### M — Monitored  

If a tree falls in the prod forest and nobody gets an alert, did it crash? Instrument with structured logs, metrics, and traces. Dashboards reveal trends; alerts catch regressions; error budgets inform product trade‑offs.

## Putting CUTE TYPE HAM into Practice

1. **Add the table to your PR template.** Reviewers tick off each row.  
2. **Automate what you can** (A) so the human checklist stays short.  
3. **Run a monthly “HAM audit.”** Check monitoring dashboards for blind spots.  
4. **Hold a “CUTE TYPE HAM” lunch‑and‑learn.** Walk new teammates through examples.  
5. **Celebrate adherence.** Shout‑out PRs that exemplify the acronym in Slack.

## Conclusion

CUTE TYPE HAM isn’t a silver bullet; it’s a compass. It points your team toward composable, understandable, environment‑agnostic, human‑friendly software that’s a joy to build **and** a breeze to operate. Print the table, pin it near your stand‑up board, and let the acronym turn principles into deeds.

Happy shipping—and may your builds be hermetic and your monitors quiet.
