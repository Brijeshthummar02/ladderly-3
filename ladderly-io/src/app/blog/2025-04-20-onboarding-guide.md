Onboarding rapidly empowers you to create impact rapidly and creates a positive impression that can carry over into added influence, effectiveness, positive performance reviews, ability to opt-in to projects of choice, higher job satisfaction, and faster career progress!

## Take Onboarding Notes

Many low-level tasks for onboarding are not routinely included in task tracking tools, but you will want to keep track. So create a personal Google Doc or a self-directed running email thread. Keep track of tasks in this document, and also note people of interest, terms, teams, technical conventions, and links to other documents and resources.

## Budget Your Time

Because you are operating outside of traditional task management software, it is important to deliberately manage your own time. This problem will likely fade in the course of a few sprints, and full capture of your work in the team's standard task tracking software is a great market that onboarding is largely complete.

As part of [managing your time](/blog/2025-04-18-time-management), implement email filters and aggressively archive emails. Implementing Inbox Zero at onboarding time may be more feasible than implementing it later on.

## Align with Your Manager

A good signal that you onboarded effectively will be when you first performance review goes well. Work backwards from that to get a view into what you should be doing now. Your manager controls your performance review, so you should prioritize their preferences.

As part of your initial onboarding notes, identify your manager's preferred communication style and cadence. If you are given an onboarding buddy or perhaps multiple individuals that you will work deeply with during your onboarding phase, get similar information from them. You are specifically looking to strike a balance between self-study and escalating help requests to others.

You should have a strong bias to autonomy and resist asking for help, but adjust this to accomodate the expectations of your manager and team. Instead of asking for answers, ask for tools, resources, and contacts. Set up intro meetings with relevant stakeholders. Use the [seven core search techniques](/blog/2025-03-30-debugging-tips#seven-core-search-techniques) and [commercial search patterns](/blog/2025-03-30-debugging-tips#commercial-patterns) to take full advantage of the enterprise knowledge stores you find.

Agree on a definition of done for onboarding. If you can onboard in a month, do so. If onboarding is expected to take multiple months, identify monthly goals. [A 30-60-90 Day Plan](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/starting-new-job/30-60-90-day-plan) is a common tool to consider. Once onboarding is complete, study up on quarterly and annual goals for your manager, company, and team. Understand the team's formal charter and your manager's personal goals. Identify the OKRs and North Stars that your team uses.
