## Why Use a Specialist Model?

You can ask the General Consultant AI anything, and you hopefully get some value, but in many cases a specialist model will do a better job for three main reasons:

1. Specialist models are trained on additional instructions in order to improve performance in certain use cases.
2. Specialist models omit information irrelevant to their designated use case, improving focus and domain-relevant result with less chance of irrelevant feedback, at the cost of not being able to answer questions outside of their domain.
3. Specialist models are trained on an opinionated process, so they can assume certain next steps that you may not have even asked about. Where the general consultant mainly seeks to answer your questions, specialist models will sometimes push back, reframe, or disregard certain instructions. These tools are sometimes meant to train you rather than to automate your work.

## The Interview Simulator AI

This tool can provide mock interviews of various kinds:

1. Coding round: leetcode-style, practical questions, or take-home projects.
2. Behavioral rounds
3. System design
4. Recruiter screen simulation
5. Causal and technical conversation

The tool can perform the interview, grade your performance, provide tips on improving results, and it can also help you translate your experience into a collection of STAR+ Method responses.

## Job Offer Negotiation AI

This tool walks you through how to obtain high-pay competing offers, identify whether you are being compensated fairly, and provides specific tactics on how to improve your offer.

## The Professional RPG AI

This tool generates role playing scenarios based on professional situations then evaluates your performance and coaches you to improved communication, collaboration, problem solving, and a variety of other skills with an emphasis on the soft skills.

## PMTLM AI

This tool is a product manager and a tech lead manager rolled into one. Given a product idea, business idea, or design problem, it helps build and evaluate the business case, an optional PRD, and then it seamlessly moves into technical design, walking you through opinionated design document construction, to ultimately evaluate potential risk-adjusted ROI and priority of work inclusive of business and technical considerations.
