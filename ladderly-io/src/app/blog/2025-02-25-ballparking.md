Ballparking is estimation with low rigor. When we talk about ballparking a metric, particularly for project impact estimation, we mean estimation without confidence intervals, tests of causality, and other elements of rigorous formal statistics. This article will explain when, why, and how to use ballparking metrics for job search and design purposes.

## When is Ballparking Useful?

Ballparking is useful any time empirical data is relevant to a decision. This article will focus on two specific cases, but there are many more:

1. Project Evaluation for the Job Search
2. Project Evaluation in Solution Design

Instead of choosing cases where low rigor is allowable, flip your mental model and realize that all measures are primitively observed or created in a state of low rigor. At every stage of analysis, we can optionally choose to apply marginally more analytical rigor. We should only make that investment if the marginal benefit is worth the marginal cost.

It turns out that the normal level of rigor in the software engineering industry is lower than the standard level in academic research, which is intuitive for many reasons including the fact that researchers are specialists.

You might worry, then, that this pattern breaks for scientific work, and it does but not much. Researchers do have slightly longer resumes on average. If you are interested in applying for SWE and DS roles you can simply maintain two resumes, and you may highlight different metrics within each resume. You can ballpark figures on both of them.

## General Tips - TODO

SMART metrics are useful in the job search and in solution design because they allow the audience to make an informed decision.

Ballparked metrics, similar to any other metrics, are useful as a component of media for at least two reasons:

1.

In both the job search and in solution design, a key component of ballparking

It turns out that the optimal level of analytical rigor in the industry is lower than the standard level of rigor in an acadmic journal.

This makes sense because researchers are specialists, so they occupy themselves with tasks

Even for valuable projects, the optimal level of analytical rigor design often falls short of what would be considred allowable at top journals.

This article will specifically focus on the case of project design and the job search.

Analysis takes time and money to perform, then it often has a communication cost due to the complexity of the analysis. It's a smart move to have two different design processes within your engineering company, so that you can support thorough design when needed and a lighter weight design most of the time, perhaps moving work descriptions directly into your project management software.

In the case of a resume or an interview, you have much less time to communicate results:

1. A recruiter looks at your resume for [six to seven seconds](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/how-long-do-employers-look-at-resumes) and the best practice for your resume is to take a single page if possible.
2. Recruiters and interviewers don't have the means to verify your scientific claims even if they wanted to.
3. Your competitors are ballparking,

It turns out that the best practice for a resume is to take a single page if possible, and project descriptions are often a single sentence. Your design documents should be longer than a single sentence. Your ballparked project metrics

In the case of design,

ow rigor. Rigor has a cost and you should add rigor only when the benefit of investing in the process outweighs the cost.

Not only is rigorous science costly to perform, it is also costly to communicate:

1. It takes time and space. You, your audience, your resume, your employer, and so on, all lack time and space.
2. Most people don't understand scientific methods and you don't h

I am tempted to say that ballparking is always useful because it fills two roles:

1. Providing baseline signal or description.
2. Providing cardinal information, allowing for choice between

Ballparking is always useful, science is sometimes useful. Science can be thought of as the application of rigor to estimation, and rigor has cost.

Ballparking is almost always useful, at least as a starting point. Scientific measures should be thought of as refinements of ballparked measures instead of a different category.

Ballparking can be used to quickly evaluate task value for forward-facing purposes such as triage, design, and prioritization, as well as for retrospective purposes, such as to provide a SMART metric to go along with a project completed at a prior company.

Ballparking can give confidence to designs and behavioral stories by providing robust project evaluation. Robust evaluation refers to a project evaluation using a basket of statistics instead of a single metric. Very often, optimizing on a single metric becomes a pitfall resulting in design overfitting, but if a project provides positive signals across a range of relatively independent metrics, the project is in some sense less risky and can lead to higher confidence.

Even if a collection of metrics are highly correlated or endogenous, rather than independent, using multiple metrics can improve project communication because stakeholders may be familiar with certain metrics. In fact, you may want some redundant metrics as this provides robustness against measurement error and improves observability.

Ballparked figures are typical for use in the behavioral interview, the resume, the job search, and ordinary conversation. When you make a claim around your project impact in a non-scientific context, there are four important norms to consider:

1. Your claim should be plausible.
2. Your claim should be relevant.
3. Your claim should not be scientific.

four main norms apply in non-scientific contexts:

1. There is no expectation of scientific rigor. You don't need to perform a causal analysis. You don't need to prove signifant difference from a counterfactual. It's fine to round numbers.
2. There is an expectation of reasonability

3. It should be relevant.

Ballparked figures are subject to interrogation, but the method

The resume and behavioral interviews both draw on a list of accomplishments on the part of the job candidate. The candidate is ideally able to tell a cohesive story using these accomplishments which signals to the employer that the candidate meets or exceeds the criteria the employer hopes to hire. An important component of the storytelling is the use of quantified impact metrics.

This article will focus on solving a common pitfall which is a lack of quantified impact. See `21. Advanced Behavioral Interview Prep` for a discussion focused on the storytelling component. Indeed, from a language model perspective, much of a good resume is a distillation of the behavioral interview, so understanding the behavioral interview is key to writing a good resume.

A common pitfall in the job search is the lack of quantified impact in the resume, which is often an indication of weak behavioral interview material as well because the same achievements and metrics which perform well in the behavioral interview are typically noted on the resume.

Let's assume that you have a list of STOARR anecdotes.

## In the Job Search

Ballparking provides achievement metrics, and here are a few examples of when to use those metrics on the job search:

1. [During interviews including behavioral interviews](blog/2025-02-24-behavioral-interviews), hiring manager conversations, recruiter screens, and more.
2. In the resume, which is a distillation of the behavioral interview.
3. When social networking and creating social media content. See, for instance, [this suggested referral seeking script](/blog/2025-01-20-social-networking-scripts#main-cold-referral-seeking-script) which references a recent achievement.

### Case Study: Ballparking Renewed Contract Value

In 2016, I was working at SAIC on the Official Correspondence (OC) project, which was contracted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The OC team was a scaled agile team of over 50 headcount tasked with modernizing Patent Examiner legal document creation. I had been working as a JavaScript Developer on the main web app and became aware of a priority pain point: Patent Examiners needed to author Custom Documents in Microsoft Word and no one in the team had experience with this. I took initiative to create a proof of concept using JavaScript to create an MS Word extension.

As a result of my proof of concept work, I was able to identify that the JavaScript API for Office was unable to support the complexity of the Custom Document requirements. I advocated for a full solution in Visual Basic and taught myself Visual Basic concurrently. With client support, SAIC leadership supported the decision to build Custom Document support in Visual Basic and I was made team lead of a team that grew to 13 headcount including 9 engineers and other staff.

In telling this story in interviews, I initially struggled to communicate the value of my work. While I had been told that the Custom Documents feature was make-or-break for the contract, the boolean fact of contract renewal was viewed as a weak estimate of impact by some and some interviewers were also skeptical of the claim that my work was the main driver of the contract renewal. After retrospectively ballparking impact, I found I was much more succesful with this story. Here's how I ballparked the final figure I claim today, an impact of at least $1 million for my contribution:

1. I was paid around $70,000 per year at the time, and I was paid less than average as an early career engineer.
2. For 50 contractors, this conservatively represents a cost center of about $3.5 million.
3. SAIC averages over 10% margin on their contracts.
4. From 1-4 we can conservatively estimate the contract value at $4 million. This is independently plausible given that the average value of a General Services Administration (GSA) contract was $2.9 million in 2016.
5. Let's assume the Custom Documents feature explains a minority of the contract value. We can estimate a 25% multiplier as the as the middle option between zero and 50%. This results in a ballparked value of $1 million.
6. This estimate is independently plausible given the headcount of the Custom Document feature team within the larger OC team.
