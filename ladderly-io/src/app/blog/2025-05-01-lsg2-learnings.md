Ladderly Small Group (LSG) Cohort 2 provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of our small group coaching program and highlighted areas for improvement in expectation setting and program design. This article shares key learnings from the cohort's experience and outcomes.

## Cohort Overview

LSG2 was a senior-leaning small group focused on job search optimization. The cohort attracted significant interest with 60 initial expressions of interest, 18 completed applications, and 14 admitted students. Admission criteria included factors like sponsorship status, ensuring participants could fully engage with the program's opportunities.

## Program Structure and Participation

The program experienced notable attrition:

- 7 students dropped within the first two weeks
- 3 more dropped by month two
- 4 students remained active at the two-month mark

Despite the attrition, all students with measured outcomes showed significant improvement in their job search metrics, even those who dropped out early. The most common reason for dropping was program cost.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Expectation Management

One critical learning was the importance of clear expectation setting. Some participants joined with misconceptions about the program's offerings, such as expecting immediate executive introductions before completing foundational work. This highlighted the need for:

- Clear communication about program features and prerequisites
- Transparent discussion of typical outcomes and timelines
- Emphasis on the sequential nature of job search optimization

### 2. Outcome Patterns

The data revealed several important patterns:

- Measurable improvements typically require 1-2 months to manifest
- Early dropouts still benefited from initial resume reviews and resource recommendations
- Success metrics showed significant improvements:
  - Application to interview ratios improved 1.5-10x
  - Networking performance increased
  - Interview performance enhanced

### 3. Success Stories

At the two-month mark, the active participants demonstrated strong progress:

- One student secured a job offer
- One student was in an ongoing FAANG interview process
- Two students had active interviews at non-FAANG companies

Even among early dropouts, at least one secured a new position, though comprehensive tracking of this group is ongoing.

### 4. Program Design Insights

The experience highlighted several program design considerations:

- Price sensitivity among participants
- The importance of managing burnout and job search fatigue
- The value of early wins and quick feedback loops
- The need for clear communication about typical job search timelines

## Future Improvements

Based on these learnings, Ladderly.io is implementing several improvements:

1. Enhanced pre-program communication about:

   - Typical outcomes and timelines
   - Program features and prerequisites
   - Realistic expectations for executive networking

2. Better support for managing job search fatigue and burnout

3. More structured tracking of outcomes across all participants, including early dropouts

4. Clearer communication about the 2-6 month typical job search timeline

## Conclusion

LSG2 provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of our small group coaching model while highlighting areas for improvement. The cohort demonstrated that even with significant attrition, the program can deliver meaningful improvements in job search outcomes. Future cohorts will benefit from these learnings through improved expectation setting and program design.

Stay tuned for 3-6 month updates as we continue tracking outcomes and refining our approach based on this valuable experience.
