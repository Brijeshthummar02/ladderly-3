Transcript:
today we are reacting to developer
roadmaps roadmap.sh this is the sixth
most starved project on github uh where
do you go through it step by step and
compare it to Ladderly
by the way here's Ladderly Ladderly as
an open source learning uh like
educational system
so kind of an alternative to free code
camp the first impression is that
there's way too much here if someone
asks you hey i'd like to learn to code
what should i do sending them here
would seem to be confusing what i would
prefer instead is right out of the gate
it should suggest a path i recommend you
learn react not python and that is a
stepping stone towards becoming a full
stack developer

Title: participants gave a median assessment, that GPT-4 material was written at a master's level of educat
Transcript:
so i mentioned that i ran an experiment
and participants could not distinguish
material that was written by
gp4 across the board of educational
levels including graduate degree holders
they could tell about a third of the
time here's the kicker the written
material was a full page in length
multiple paragraphs each paragraph
having multiple sentences but let me
also point out that what i'm saying is
not quite what you're saying so you say
when there's enough output it doesn't
feel right my respondents also said this
respondents would mark papers written by
gp4 as not written by a phd holder they
properly identified that they said this
is not written by a phd holder and yet
they couldn't tell that it was written
by gp4 so the ability to say this
doesn't quite feel academic is actually
a very different thing than the ability
to say not only is this not academic it
was written by ai those are very
different identifications you see i find
this really creepy i don't know about
you

Title: Discovering that people can't identify a document authored by GPT-4
Transcript:
what's your stack well we're doing data
analysis so it's 100%
python sean says do you have to
subscribe in gpt chat or is it free you
have to pay this is gpt 4 very important
nuance that's not only missed by a lot
of the population it's also missed by a
lot of the academy so a lot of people
will talk about chat gpt
hallucinating and they will be talking
about 3.5 which is substantially
inferior to a gpt 4 it's not even in the
same model class so gpt 3.5 is a large
language model gp4 is a multimodal model
you see how it's drawn a graph
approximately
27% of respondents believe that document
8 was written by
gpt that means people cannot tell when
it's written by gpt look at
that oh
wow and that is a rating above a five
which is imminently reasonable because
it's a scale of 1 to
10 now there is 1 two three four five
six seven 8 nine
10 um six
seven there's sort of like a mean bias
here there's sort of a mean bias here
where um people are picking five and i
think they're doing that because five
feels like the middle of one and 10 but
it's actually not the middle of one and
10 is it it's below the
middle so i wonder if there is a uh like
a cognitive response bias
here um
still even even if it were the middle
even if this was a ninepoint scale and
they had picked five that's still not
saying i believe this is gpt it's saying
i'm i'm like perfectly indifferent i
literally don't know it's right in the
middle so i think it's extremely
reasonable to
construct a binary out of the 10-point
scale by saying above below five
uh i think that's totally reasonable

Title: Css turkey
Transcript:
i want to make a relevant addition to my
web portfolio and it's thanksgiving so
let's make a turkey as a web developer i
know that a turkey will be drawn with
html and css so i google css turkey i
found a few results and checked them out
but i'm really happy with the top result
so this is what it looks like so i copy
it and i put it in my github portfolio
and deploy it to github pages at this
point it's basically someone else's work
which is not really a plagiarism issue
in programming it's just that it doesn't
demonstrate any of my skill so how can i
change this turkey this collection of
html elements in a way that demonstrates
my skill well i think the tips of the
feathers can change colors so i'll make
that dynamic and add some javascript you
can't see it in this picture but the
eyes are doing this weird googly thing
i'll take that away because it's
annoying and then i can also add some
audio so when you click it i'll make it
squawk so here's the final result i live
coded the whole thing i'll put a link to
this and a link to the youtube video in
the comments be sure to follow my page
if you want to learn to code you can
totally do it drop a comment if there's
anything i can answer for you

Title: developer soft skills üêê fr
Transcript:
okay so this is a communication
technique if i need to communicate
something to you and i'm worried that
you might take it in a negative way and
that's not my intent i'm going to make
really shorts surround it in positive
context to make it really clear to you
that i'm not trying to be critical or
negative i'm providing some feedback
that it might hurt but like my intent
here is good it's kind of the same idea
of constructive criticism as opposed to
like just being mean so it's a sandwich
because there's positive on both sides
of the feedback you deliver so for
example let's say i'm dealing with a
junior programmer and they wrote some
code it's just not good i'm not going to
say hey this code is just not good that
would be like mean and not really
helpful i'm going to start the
conversation in a positive way like hey
thanks for submitting this pull request
thanks for working so hard then i want
to point out what they can do better
let's try to phrase it in non-accusatory
neutral terms so instead of saying hey
you forgot to format your code i can say
i noticed the build is failing if you
run the formatter it'll probably pass
then finish out positive i'll be so glad
to approve and ship this when it's ready

Title: Jewell MOOC vs Bootcamp vs Mentorship
Transcript:
what makes springboard and the code had
to be front in path better than the
Ladderly curriculum so i wouldn't say
that they're both better in general code
academy is a mooc that will have vastly
inferior learning and job placement
outcomes it's better for some people
because it's a lot cheaper the other
thing to note is that the Ladderly
curriculum treats codecademy as a
sub-module so if you participate in
Ladderly i will encourage you to
complete codecademy as a sub module of
Ladderly springboard on the other hand
is a more expensive option compared to
Ladderly again you can use them
together so Ladderly can be treated as
a supplement to springboard and also
springboard is much better recognition
among employers so i don't think that
any of these are necessarily better it
kind of depends on your personal
situation

Title: 8 doubt management strategies
Transcript:
five doubt management strategies the
first thing i would encourage you to do
this is absolutely critical is
understand and respect your doubts what
is a doubt it is not a guarantee of
failure it is a declaration of the
possibility of failure the truth is
there is almost always a possibility of
failure so the first thing to do is give
your doubt a little respect give the
devil his due in your doubt there may be
some grain of truth we want to
understand what that grain of truth is
and if we investigate our doubt and find
that there is no truth truth there we
can easily move on to number two but if
we do find some truth we can take action
to address it let's say for example i
doubt that i can accomplish some task by
some date maybe that's true maybe i need
to be less ambitious in my task maybe i
need to move the date maybe i need to
increase the time each day between now
and that date that i'm allocating so i
can respect it by taking it seriously
that doesn't mean believing it
completely at face value the second
thing we must do this is not optional is
we must ignore our doubts even if the
doubt is true you must set it aside at
least for a time so that you can make
progress remember a doubt is not a
guarantee of failure it is a declaration
of the possibility of failure let's say
there is a truly 50/50 chance that you
succeed if you are going to ever realize
the 50% positive chance that you do
succeed you need to put in time and
effort on your task which means for a
time you need to set your doubts to the
side even if they are true you need to
ignore them and focus on your work the
third thing you can do with a doubt is
use logic evidence and reason to
disprove them this is one of my
favorites let's say that you're going
about your week you're working on this
task you have a goal to be done by the
end of the week this is the second day
and you realize how far away you are
from the finish line a doubt starts to
creep in well you have an option to
disprove that doubt by pointing to the
progress you made yesterday the doubt
might say well if you continue on that
progress it won't be enough we won't be
done is that true let's take it
seriously let's give it respect let's
let's run the numbers many times you'll
find it's simply not true if you make
the same amount of progress as you did
yesterday for four more days you'll be
done you can engage in logical selft
talk here and you can take doubt and
turn it into a beneficial strategy maybe
the doubt is right maybe if you repeat
monday's progress five times you will
not be done but that provides the
opportunity for you to say well which of
these other days might i be able to
double down maybe i have spare time on
thursday so if you take a doubt
seriously it can become a benefit so
maybe let's have a little trust that
your body is giving you a doubt for some
good reason another reason your body
might be giving you doubt is if you lack
sleep if you're not exercising properly
or getting the proper nutrition when it
comes to nutrition your basic vitamins
will be helpful but also certain things
like theanine which are optional
supplements can serve to reduce anxiety
if you're taking in a large amount of
caffeine pair it with theanine l
theanine this would occur naturally in
green tea so that green tea is a
combination of caffeine that doesn't
give you as much jitters because of the
presence of theanine that in contrast to
spamming black coffee which will
increase your generalized anxiety
without good reason so again use the
mental strategy to interrogate the
anxiety understand the reason why and
the answer might just be you need water
and sleep last recommendation is mindful
meditation because you're dealing with
doubts you're going to want to engage in
selft talk so your meditation should be
mindful here is a recommended strategy
for a mindful meditation identify the
root cause of the doubt acknowledge that
there may be some truth in it appreciate
that you have made progress not all is
doomed there are good things that have
come along with this uh negative
situation and then simply resolve to try
accept that you have no guarantee of
success but also accept that you have no
guarantee of failure and meditate on the
resolution to try hope this helps follow
for more oh just thought of three more
these are definitely going to help you
exaggerated absolute language would be
like i can't do anything this is never
going to happen i can't remember a thing
uh avoid language like that follow for
more

Title: 3-5 projects showing full stack
Transcript:
so for most people breaking an attack
here's my advice on projects you want
three projects four is even better five
your portfolio will be better but it's a
net loss on value of your job search
because you should be doing other things
like preparing for data structure and
algorithm interviews and social
networking instead of going for that
fifth project the three projects are all
blogs you're gonna do a vanilla blog a
react.js blog and a typescript next blog
by doing the same project you get to
focus on learning the technologies and
getting job ready which is actually more
important there is a substantial value
added to a fourth project which can be
your passion project so you're not just
building blogs there's something that
you have personal interest in but really
that's optional because even though
that's valuable there's other valuable
stuff you could be doing like social
networking and data structure and
interview prep make sure you deploy them
and you link them on your resume so that
a recruiter or someone scanning your
resume can click a link and use it as a
user most of these people screening your
resume are not going to browse deep in
your code it's going to be impressive
enough that the thing is deployed and
working hope this helps follow for more

Title: Realistic tasks you will perform as a software engineer
Transcript:
so what do professional software
engineers actually do i'll tell you what
i did yesterday as an example my
company's making a new product and it is
dynamically priced based on some stuff a
user puts into a form so i made a new
fast api route and then we take that
information that the user sends and we
put it into a library so my service
that's in fast api is calling a library
so i also had to make some updates in
that library i used a whole lot of
reference code so we already have a
bunch of products so when i make a new
or when i make a new pricing function in
this library i need it to be similar to
the existing logic when my draft was
done i prepared it for peer review so i
made sure that it was formatted we used
black passing my pc type checks and
basically passing the pipeline when all
this was done i had to recruit teammates
to review my code and then i will have
to create a release of the library and
do an install in the service and do
another p request lots of fun

Transcript:
then i asked what makes programming hard
for beginners i said gatekeeping and
non-specific advice like the best
language depends if your goal is to land
a job as quickly as possible i strongly
recommend learning react but what would
you say in answer to this question

URL: https://youtu.be/Ao8njAd2cuM
Transcript:
so this is such a good question and it
actually turns out to be like a kind of
a verbose answer so i'm going to blurt
it out really quickly here and it might
not make sense but stay tuned to my
channel i'll do a three-part follow-up
on how to land an interview and how to
land an algorithm interview specifically
here's the super super short version one
blast out a ton of applications 50 to
100 per week for a minimum of four weeks
two make sure your linkedin is optimized
three social network and if you want a
social network with corporate recruiters
you want to apply in their system before
you network with them it makes it easier
for them
that's how you land an interview in
general tip number four for algorithm
interviews specifically is that is going
to depend on the company the companies
that tend to use algorithm interviews
are tier one companies like google
facebook and so forth as well as tier
one one of these they have their
recruiting model modeled off of tier one
companies even if they're not actually
tier one so if you want algorithm
interview specifically it's a matter of
targeting a company

companies there's going to be people who
know multiple programming languages
there's going to be people who had
internships at google there's going to
be people who have github projects that
have thousands of stars and thousands of
users already there's no way you can
beat a million people but you don't have

answer is javascript
learn react not python start with

css and javascript
work with the dom api and vanilla
javascript you're going to hate it
that's a good thing after you start
hating it use react you'll realize why
react is awesome because it abstracts

know what that means right now but if
you take that approach you'll really
appreciate what react does and then

something i'm actually the person who's
reviewing those cbs as a recruiter we
flick through and we can tell straight
away that your cv is completely generic
and completely irrelevant for the jobs
we are applying that you're applying for
we can see the 20 other jobs that you've
also applied for at our company that
again completely irrelevant there's no
targeted cover letter your cv has none
of the skills that we're looking for
instead of spraying and praying and
hoping that something will stick why not
get a bit more strategic look at the job
you actually want to apply for look at
the requirements what do they want to
see how do your skills correlate to that
and highlight that target your cv cut
out all the rubbish that's not relevant
and target your cv and then get a bit
strategic about how you connect with
people on linkedin that are close to
that company recruiters in that company

Title: good to clarify what we mean by vs traditional education like CS /
Transcript:
so this is a good call out there's
confusion around what it means to break
into tech so this user is saying that
they got their first job intact as data
science and this is very doable and then
they went on to say that they have a
master's in data analytics so that's not
what breaking into tech is breaking into
tech means you are outside of tech
you're an outsider you have an
alternative education and alternative
pathway into tech if you have a master's
degree in data analytics this is the
traditional route so you're not breaking
into that you're just a party impact
um so yeah uh you can totally have a
data science role as your first job it's
not the most common thing to do like
data analytics business analytics
product analysis these are are more
common but you could go straight into
data science if you have an advanced
degree like a master's in stats or
whatever as mentioned

Title: Economics to Programming Transition
Transcript:
thanks for the question there's a few
ways to answer this question one way is
just you do the normal way forget that
you're an economist and you learn to
code like everybody else
in that case i learned i recommend you
learn html css javascript and react then
maybe typescript if you go that way
you'll probably be able to start coding
as your job in like six months building
websites i'm not sure are you american
citizen because that is going to impact
how much you can get paid and things
like that in us you would probably make
like at least 60 grand doing that now if
you are an economist then there are some
more interesting things you could do the
question is how much experience do you
have and do you have a background in
statistics so if you're an economist
with couple years of experience i'm
expecting you can do statistics with at
least excel if not stata or spss and
hopefully you have some data
visualization skills maybe you know
tableau for example in this case
learning python would be a smart idea
for you you can probably even use python
in your current role for statistics then
you can also get a data engineering role
if you want to make a slow and steady
transition you could get a job as a
business analyst

Title: Learn HTML pt 2/5
Transcript:
learn html part 205 let's talk about
semantic tags semantic html code with
india she's pretty cool go check out her
channel i am going to put her on blast
though because she has an anti-pattern
on screen it's worth it for you to look
through one of these supposedly
comprehensive eight plus hour videos and
try to spot a dozen issues if they are a
youtube expert with over a hundred
thousand subscribers and you can look
through their video and find a dozen
issues that's a pretty good sign that
you know what you're talking about so
that's a good check anyway b is an
example of an anti-pattern it's supposed
to be bold but it's not descriptive it's
not semantic what does semantic mean
semantic means it describes itself using
natural language b doesn't do that what
does b mean instead use the strong tag
another benefit of strong over bold is
that strong is implementation agnostic
so a screen reader can read a strong tag
and choose to implement strong text as a
louder voice bold is fairly specific to
font styling so it's not transferable so
that's the point of semantic tags
they're descriptive article section
footer those are some other logical
blocks and consumers can use them as
they see fit like google search results

Title: 3 important details about the learning small group starting Feb 3!
Transcript:
i'm a software engineer with 10 years of
experience and i'm leading a small group
teaching people to learn to code
starting february 3rd here's three
important details you need to know about
it first you don't need to be there
every saturday i've had people reach out
like i can't commit to every saturday
the program is running all year long i
don't expect you to be there every
saturday all year you should be able to
learn to code within 6 months which
means you should have like 3 months of
saturdays you can miss and that'll be
fun second this is a full stack web
development curriculum if you're
interested in cyber security or data
analysis this is not for you and we
won't be doing python third all skill
levels are welcome this is going to be a
diverse group of people who have never
written code and people who already have
programming roles and i'm already stoked
about the gender diversity and stuff in
the class that's already there each
session is going to come with some
office hours and if you're already an
advanced programmer you can just use
these office hours for like one-on on
with me it's still going to be valuable
for you hope this was interesting if
you're interested drop a comment or
shoot me a dm or just go sign up at

Title: Web TCG Dev update!
Transcript:
open source web game development update
we merged pull request number 12 for
Aria's Tale.com these give us tags on the
card and image search bugs trolls
environment cards item cards these are
all examples of card tags to get to that
table go to the gallery and pick search
cards and images at rst.com and this
pull request was started by robert so
i'm super excited that this is
officially a community project now here
you can see we use a small react
functional component it is a styled span
to make those pill tags and the
background color is a hashed hsl
function which means that we can hold
the saturation and lightness constant so
that we can always make sure there's a
good contrast with a white text but we
can let that hue vary on a string hash
so that the same tag string always gives
us the same color but different tag
strings give us different hue variation

programming hit the like button and

Title: Modified TDD is Best TDD
Transcript:
i want to create a new component react
but i want to do tdd so i start by
making a unit test that references a
component that doesn't exist fails stub
the file and now the test passes i just
made a tdd increment and i also just
wasted a bunch of time but let's not
stop there because every time that i do
a new commit i need my test to pass
right i don't realize that there are
these like patterns and conventions
embedded in other components how do i
make an http call what variables do i
name how should i name my id that i'm
referencing uh used ref on the component
so every time i write a test for these
things i am assuming implementation and
then that implementation turns out not
to be correct so i have to refactor the
component and the unit test doubling my
loe instead here's what i do i create
the component and then i create the test
and i just make sure everything works
before i submit a pr at the end the
result is the same you have a set of
unit tests that pass but it's a lot less
loe in the middle so this is a modified
tdd pattern that i suggest for
developers

Title: is react confusing?
Transcript:
what up suitcase when i initially
learned react i hated it it was
confusing for me too now that i'm on the
other side i think it's super high value
totally worth that initial upfront
headache in this video i'm going to give
you five notes ways to think about react
that let the value of react shine
through like why are we using react i'm
going to address that and i'm going to
mitigate eliminate a lot of that
confusion so these are my five tips let
me know if they help one what do
frameworks in general do we're going to
start by talking about angular or ember
or another framework because react is
not a framework we're going to show what
those do why it's kind of problematic
and then why we would prefer react
instead angular is extremely opinionated
you're going to be able to read the
angular style guide follow it to the t
ship an application in a week that's
great because it's clear it's
problematic because if you want to
customize anything it's really really
hard and it's also inefficient because
often you're bringing in tools and
you're bringing in logic that you really
don't need how do i build a web page
what do i do if someone is not
authenticated and i want to redirect
them how do i make an http request how
do i statically generate a site how do i
dynamically generate a site angular has
very clear very strong opinions on all
of these react doesn't react does one
thing it just controls what shows up on
the page so we can think about a typical
framework as following mvc model view
controller model is like the data
objects that you have like there can be
a model for my shoe it has things like
size weight color view is what is
actually showing up on the page and see
the controller is some logic that
determines what shows up on the page
react by itself is just vc there's no m
so concept one full frameworks help you
ship applications really fast and
they're strongly opinionated concept two
react is just a templating engine a
rendering library a view controller it's
not a full mvc framework we like that
because it ultimately allows us to
customize things and ship less code and
it's more efficient at the end of the
day concept three why don't we go even
more minimal and just do this in vanilla
because vanilla is too hard so you can
think about the document api when you
use document. get element document.
create append etc insert remove jsx
react this is a key lesson it can be
viewed as simply a syntactic sugar an
easy way to use the document api that's
the main way that i communicate what is
react it's just an easy way to use the
document api concept four traditional
development you have html css and
javascript clean separation of concerns
react flips it on its head and it merges
them all into javascript so you want to
learn html css and javascript first then
learn react it'll be much easier than if
you try to dive right into react so
concept four is that it's going to take
all the elements of web development and
allow you to write them in a single
javascript syntax that looks like html
but you can actually do a lot more with
it concept five hard to hear but really
important react is necessary it is not
sufficient we do want the whole mvc we
do want a whole framework so i need a
library stack that includes react but
it's not limited to react i might want
to add redux i might want to add apollo
so go to code academy follow the
front-end engineering path you will
learn how to build a full react
application and it's more than just
react but that's going to give you a
good starting point hope this helps

Title: (as a coder) removing interview stress
Transcript:
in today's market the companies need you
more than you need them great point from
fong let me build on that with three
more strategies that will help you
relieve stress combat anxiety coming up
to and through an interview overall
strategy here is to make the interview
be a good thing now that it's a good
thing you want it to happen you're
excited instead of this risky thing that
you currently perceive it is that's
triggering your anxiety number one a
bunch of people are worried about in
this interview i'm going to meet people
i've never met before how is my first
impression going to be isn't that risky
actually it's a great social networking
opportunity however the interview goes
always finish up with something like
this i've had a great time here it was a
pleasure to meet you regardless of how
this turns out i'd love to connect with
you on linkedin do each and every
interview is an opportunity to practice
this unique skill of interviewing so
whether or not they extend an offer you
gained value just by going through the
motions if you screwed up a question you
got a great diagnostic on exactly what
to practice three job searches and
numbers games so whether this company
makes an offer or not don't stress about
that you do enough of these from a
probability standpoint you're gonna get
a job

Title: Simple Architecture is a Flex
Transcript:
so my netfi psychiatric site is a very
simple architecture and let's talk about
why that's actually a flex so first of
all it does use nextjs which is a
framework so react is not a framework
but next is but i did avoid
infrastructure costs a continuously
running server or even something like a
lambda so what's cheaper than serverless
is jamstack so currently nextjs is the
optimal framework to pick for a jamstack
architecture that will let you
completely compile out to static build
at build time and host for free so my
client is a small business i don't want
them paying for like aws and stuff they
can just pay for a domain name why would
i want to charge them more the client
requirements are simple so my library
stack is simple why would i bring in
material design when i really only have
like five components and i would have to
customize all five reference components
out of material anyway no it's much
simpler and leaner faster load times to
just build those from scratch

Title: Don't overcomplicate devops, and definitely dont skip it!
Transcript:
if i have like a restaurant website i
would never send uh a
restaurant consumer someone who wants to
place an order i would never send them
here this is the code repository this is
the code form of the website i would
send them to the deployed or rendered
form of the website and this is what's
missed in a whole bunch of other
programming classes is how to deploy it
deploying it is called devops so here's
the software development life cycle
let's get an image of this we're going
to analyze that means we're going to
basically come up with the idea for what
we want to build in this case a
restaurant website very straightforward
uxui design what is it going to look
like right so i might draw some pictures
in photoshop show them to people and
have some feedback and see like what
does the right website look like before
i've written any code three is
implementation this means writing the
code four is testing we're not going to
be covering testing today five is
deployment and then six is maintenance
basically um whenever the menu changes i
go and change the website too that whole
uh process is called maintenance after
it goes live making sure it's
continuously updated so that is how you
develop software de deployment is
frequently missed in many intro classes
but it's not that hard if you do it
right and that's what i want to show you

Title: 7 ways coding is actually fun
Transcript:
this is a great question and apparently
i have a lot to say on this so this is
going to be a longer video before i get
into why i think it's so fun let me say
that one of the things that's unique
about tech is that it's very diverse and
that's one of the reasons it's so fun to
so many different kinds of people for
different reasons so i'll get into why i
think it's fun but keep in mind that
whether you're more of a visual person
there's front end work making websites
if you're more of a recluse abstract
thinker there's stuff on the database
side and this is reflected in all sorts
of programmer personalities is that
there is a great amount of diversity
contrary to this narrative that there's
like this one stereotypical like type of
programmer so i do think the visual side
of it was one thing that appealed to me
especially at first it helped me learn i
could get rapid visual feedback in some
ways i am close to the stereotypical
programmer but one of the ways that i'm
quite different is that i think css is a
lot of fun and i like making like
bouncing animations and stuff like that
with css the second way is that i like
to be able to deliver like concrete wins
and it creates a snowball of wins and
you can do like multiple commits or
multiple improvements in a single day
and really get the snowball going
previously i worked in construction and
food service for whatever reason a bunch
of career switchers have a background in
food service but there is a similar
effect where i can like give you like a
sandwich and i like made a real thing
and i it makes you happy and that makes
me happy
and you can do this with programming and
it's lower stakes than construction or
maybe even food service because if i
screw it up i can just control z i don't
need to throw out the sandwich or like
report concrete right so that's the
second thing for me personally is these
like concrete incremental winds that
actually have real clear value speaking
of clear value i guess this is the third
thing or maybe the third and fourth is
that their earnings are a lot better so
like the quality of life the work life
balance is a lot better than what i've
done in the past whether in politics or
in food service or elsewhere
um and it's third or fourth because i
can also share that with other people
and i personally get a ton of fun out of
men's wearing juniors in my day job and
then also like teaching people through
social media as well as much as i like
random hobbies for fun like pottery
making or writing poetry or playing
drums i would actually rather teach you
to code than to play drums because this
is something you can like make a career
out of and it will benefit you and those
around you from a quality of life
perspective
and with drums i feel like i might
almost feel like distracting you
um and and yeah musician as a life
mostly doesn't work at least
historically and for most people if
you're a musician i don't mean to
discourage you and maybe that's changing
with new media number five is that i
like experimenting and continuously
learning i don't necessarily like
reading books although i do that but
what i what i like to do for learning is
running my own experiments with real
estate you can't you have to have a lot
of money to like run your own real
estate experiments right with
programming i can sort of tinker and see
oh this is faster and this is better for
users and i think that's really fun
number six big one is that it's remote
work compatible and so i can like go to
the places i want to be and like try the
new coffee shop and and work from there
so hope this helps

Title: How Much Data Bias is Acceptable?
Transcript:
jordan wonderful question what amount of
data bias do you think is acceptable so
for the general audience let me take a
step back and define what we even mean
by bias bias here we're using a
technical sense in terms of statistical
bias in ordinary english a bias might
refer to a tendency john you're always
doing economic analysis are you biased
towards economics and statistics that
would be called a correlation or a
tendency that in and of itself is not a
bias a bias would be if your correlation
was higher than it should be or lower
than it should be if your measurement of
correlation was incorrect or erroneous
it would be biased but the correlation
by itself totally fine in the technical
sense here's another way that bias would
basically not be acceptable and it's
also not the technical definition of ice
hey john we know that you have this
conclusion that you already have in your
mind and you're trying to sneak it in
and you're just trying to put a veneer
of statistics over the top so in
economics we would call that a moral
hazard and that's distinct from a
technical bias although in the normal
english we kind of say hey you're biased
and we're actually referring to that
moral hazard so here are two examples of
technical bias one would be omitted
variable bias say i'm doing a regression
between gender in the tech industry and
i just do a simple regression one-on-one
univariate regression but there's
actually a bunch of other things that
matter like for example personality or
risk aversion
um so if i leave those variables out if
i omit them then the statistical
coefficient of gender will be biased
because it will be including some of
those other effects that shouldn't be
attributed to it another important
technical bias is repeated measurement
bias where if i run a survey on monday
tuesday and wednesday and i get 50
responses each day and then i do a
regression on them and i don't account
for the fact that jim responded on all
three days and he actually got more
votes as it were
um then there's a bias where i'm
actually over representing jim's opinion
and i'm not really getting the opinion
of the general population so that would
be a biased result so those are formal
statistical biases there are also
informal or domain-specific biases and
economics this would include anti-market
bias anti-innovation bias anti-foreign
bias self-similarity bias
so these are biases that are results of
theories in your field and those biases
are not statistical biases in the sense
that your model is technically wrong
what they mean is that there's a
disproportionate impact between the
expected result and the observed result
so if i give somebody ten dollars and i
observe how they spend it i'm gonna
there's gonna be a systematic difference
compared to if i just ask them by survey
by questionnaire hey how would you spend
ten dollars in economics we've observed
that there's a theoretical bias there
and specifically people respond by
questionnaire that they're much more
willing to spend money
um than they in fact are when you
observe them with their cash in their
wallet so with all that background
there's situations in which an optimal
decision uses 100 biased data follow for
part two i'll give you a specific
example much more to talk about

if you're an nba coach would you want to
drive someone who is seven feet tall or
someone who is 5'3 but claims to work

end because 5'3 there's something funny
about that in the nba fact at the end
problem is that this is apples and
oranges coding and athletics are similar
in some ways and they're not similar in
other ways one way that they're really
different is that height is easy to
screen for iq is not easy to screen for
it's actually easier to directly measure
a programming skill than it is to
measure iq another issue here is that
the nba is not all basketball players
it's like the best best basketball
players so this would be like looking
just at google engineers instead of
looking at all programmers third in my
previous video i showed that average
american iq actually even slightly below
average american iq falls into the
suitable range of a programmer the
number five three that you're trying to
pick there is way below the norm and one

the economist in front of us during this
video said when you are young you worry

you're old you worry about people not
stealing your ideas so option one is
uploading stack overflow answers or
upvoting reddit answers or starring your

you go to social media tweet about it
post about it reach out to the author
and thank them number three is an open

Title: Props in React.js (Learn React pt 7)
Transcript:
learn react part seven let's talk about
components and props so we previously
talked about how jsx is a template
syntax that produces html but it's
written in javascript so at the top is a
jsx element and it will produce an html
element that's just a div react
components are also represented as jsx
you see const element equals welcome
welcome is not defined in the html spec
that is a custom user component in html
you have attributes so name sarah would
be the name attribute and react these
are props props is short for properties
and they are written as attributes so
how do we actually define welcome you
can define it as a class i don't
recommend that i recommend functional
definition and what does functional
definition mean at the bottom you can
see it's literally a javascript function
props are passed to this function just
like arguments are passed to an ordinary
javascript function so welcome with name
of sarah that would be an h1 hello sarah
in a more complicated component i could
have special functions in style and they
would be isolated to welcome instead of
global

Title: Big Tech and Small Business optimize differently
Transcript:
big tech system design pro tips stay to
the end we are often faced with
trade-offs in project management and in
system design and the so-called iron
triangle pictured in front of us is a
common mental model to help us think
through those trade-offs let me
illustrate with a recent example from my
own work so i recently designed a
microservice that empowers our data
analyst to model changes to pricings of
certain products and then understand the
impact to the bottom line beforehand
whereas previously they would have to
ship and then do some a b testing and
prod and do analysis on production data
the analysts already had certain scripts
that expected a certain table structure
so to support that and facilitate their
experience i preserved that table
structure even though a cleaner
structure would have been faster and
cheaper this example illustrates the pro
tip which is that in big tech we want to
prioritize adoption and user experience
even when it's expensive as long as we
can contain that expense to the short
run in the long run we can drive down
costs and alter the experience after
adoption is achieved

Transcript:
programming is famous because you don't
need a degree to get a job as a
programmer as an economist with a
specialty in higher education i can tell
you there's not one point of college but
over 90 percent of students go to
college in pursuit of a job after they
graduate graduating college does help
you land a job and economists explain
their ability to do that using two
popular models the signaling model and
the human capital model human capital
model says that college is giving you
skills not just soft skills but also
hard skills we use these same models to
explain why in many cases you don't need
a degree for instance graduating from a
coding boot camp can endow you with
skills and signal your value to an
employer so do yourself a favor search

until you get to the paper on conformity
and soft skills as determinants of
alternatively credentialed non-college
graduate higher ability by yours truly

option for most people delaying college
going straight into the job market for
programming is a risky move it's a
gamble it's not ideal for most people
here are six factors that contribute to
the college degree being a fantastic
investment for candidate programmers if
you've considered these six and you
still think that you are a candidate for
an exception here are five cases where i

are you the type of person who's
motivated by fear i am story time risk
aversion loss aversion are two
behavioral human traits observed across
the human race so let your guard down
hear my story don't worry about being
perceived as weak don't worry about
being perceived as abnormal this message
isn't for everybody but it's a very
common personality type and myself
included so i just got done with the
fight camp and i was trying to take it
easy and the coach there coach tommy
duquette basically motivated me against
my will because he pushed one of my
buttons and it reminded me of when i
played high school varsity football it
reminded me of something a coach of mine
did one time so i was the second
stringer there was more people behind me
but i wasn't an all-star i was basically
an average player as far as our varsity
team went like anyone i would suffer
from performance when i got tired but i
think it hit me kind of more than most
and my coaches would really struggle to
keep me motivated towards the end of a
practice one day my coach just got
frustrated and just lit into me and was
surprised to see my performance ticked
up quite a bit he goes oh you're one of
those people what we eventually
discussed later is that he found out
that i'm the type of person that's
motivated by fear and so other people on
the team were motivated by other things
like hey look to win the championship
you're gonna look so cool and i was
motivated by if you don't do this right
you're off the team so years later i
study economics and this is where it
relates to you and i today okay so
economics has something called
opportunity costs so if you're
struggling with learning to code and if
you're intimidated you think man i can't
do this you're afraid consider that the
opportunity cost is the real thing you
should be afraid of what happens if you
don't get the job what happens if you
don't get this money i'm not talking
about your personal quality life i'm
talking about who are you hurting so
frame the problem this way and it's not
quite accurate but that's not the point
the point is to push your buttons for
motivation if you don't get this money
you can't give to that charity if you
don't get this money how are you going
to take care of your family how are you
going to take care of your old parents
what if you get sick what are you going
to be able to do you're gonna be
hopeless and on the flip side of that
let me reassure you it is possible
realistic easier than you think to learn
to code i think a lot of us who have
this sort of anxiety and fear it comes
with pessimism and some of that
pessimism becomes unrealistic pessimism
and let me just reassure you that
pessimism is unfounded if you're
questioning if you can learn to code the
truth is most people who think they
can't actually can so we need to correct
that information in the american culture
that it's actually easier to code than
we think it is so reframe the situation
that way and see if it motivates you
it's motivating for me
so previously you're thinking hey i
could go the extra mile but it's a lot
of work is it really worth it i don't
know but now with the noon mindset
you're saying the opportunity cost here
if i don't do this i'm hurting people
and if i do this i'm doing the right
thing and i'm helping people like i said
again this is not quite accurate and
this is not meant to demonize people who
don't want to code what i want you to do
is adopt a mindset that can help you
push through if it's something you want
to do thanks for listening hope you took
something away from a personal story of
mine

Title: tweaks are often bargains! If you can get social buy in by renaming a method, adding a log, or smth
Transcript:
hey so this is true and this is a good
thing don't be a software engineer that
has the mindset that my way is the right
way and i just want to champion my way
that's not how to be a good engineer
when you reach out to your team and you
say hey i have this problem i'm thinking
about solving it this way what do you
think you want that to be a genuine
question and you want to be open-minded
to their honest feedback they may say it
looks good they may ask you to tweak it
or they may offer a completely different
suggestion all of these are good options
you don't have to just accept their
suggestions you talk about it you talk
about it reasonably make sure you're
being fair don't try to just advocate
for your initial solution often our
initial solution is not optimal it's
much better to have this discussion
before putting in a bunch of work
instead of after you already put in a
bunch of work where you're really going
to be strongly biased to just get a
thumbs up on what you already did you're
actually not going to be as open-minded
in addition in an interview situation if
your interviewer suggests an approach
you need to take it seriously

Title: cold DM a googler‚Ä¶?
Transcript:
the question is how do you get in so
insulting suggests that the way to get
into google is to leverage linkedin to
social network with a current google
employee i totally agree i just got an
offer from google i was able to use one
of my linkedin contacts to gain an
employee referral very confident that's
the reason i got the initial interview
and ultimate consideration of my
candidacy i want to add two notes one is
a lot of us don't have google employees
in our network here juting suggests cold
dming a current google employee who is
currently a stranger i'm going to
provide you an alternative strategy and
my second note is that i'm actually
going to agree with juan salting that
that technique is pretty good but i'm
going to add some scripts who
specifically do you contact what
specifically do you say so the
alternative to cold dm is to use blind
blind users are very liberal with their
referrals if you have a blind account go
on create a new post openly ask for
referral tag it google if you do choose
to call dm who do you reach out to what
do you say this is where the Ladderly

Title: Why Frontend Programming?
Transcript:
i specialize in teaching people how to
break an attack and learn how to code
follow my page if you're interested this
commenter asks why i recommend front-end
programming to that end great question a
bunch of reasons i'll give you three
first the mental model of a website what
a good website looks like is really
familiar to even non-technical people
the main four branches of programming
are front-end back-end devops and data
analysis data analysis is kind of
intuitive but devops is like totally
foreign to the normal person if you say
infrastructure they're thinking about
like their house and then back end is
really abstract and hard to visualize if
you're not trained in thinking that way
so building on that point too the
alternatives to front end requires
special training so you're not going to
be a good data analysis you could
actually be a little bit dangerous if
you're a data analyst that doesn't know
stats for example three is the level of
difficulty of setup with front-end
programming you already probably have
the chrome browser installed and you can
get started sandbox in the chrome dev
tools and you can also visit like
w3schools and code in your browser other
languages are growing and your ability
to have like an in-browser experience
but tools are rough outside of front end

quickly upskill to typescript and pick
up next.js leslie is 100 right at that
point you'll be job ready other than the
job search skills themselves social

misunderstood the question i thought
someone was asking about learning dino
if you're asking about learning

Title: - Land a Coding Job Completion rates are so important
Transcript:
completion rates are a huge problem for
online courses in general but they turn
out to be another reason that you want
to use coursera over udemy udacity
points out that only four percent of
students ever complete a mooc but
nanodegree programs have a 30 graduation
rate matthew alexander points out that
the completion rate problem does apply
to udemy courses with the completion
rate percent estimated at four to ten
percent across all udemy courses of
course there is a huge amount of
variation between courses but that only
creates a further problem when we are
trying to create a plan with minimal
risk for you to land a job here's the
good news coursera like udacity is an
exception to this rule specifically when
you pay to play the completion rate is
over 55 and keep in mind that the course
that we've recommended this front-end
developer certificate provided in
partnership with meta is available under
coursera plus which means you do need to
pay money and you do get that benefit of
a high completion rate about 25 percent
of coursera completers land a job that's
where Ladderly helps triple that number

Title: Sharing state in React!
Transcript:
quick video here to talk about sharing
state and react and i'll illustrate this
with a specific problem that i recently
solved in a customer relationship
management platform a crm so in this
platform you have contacts contacts will
have phone numbers and physical
addresses and email addresses the people
that you want to contact right for your
outreach what happens if people upload a
bunch of duplicates we want to be able
to detect duplicates and merge them
merging duplicates is a great example of
when we would want to share state why do
we want to share state in this case
imagine that i have that page where i
can see the list of duplicate contacts i
want to be able to click app pair and
get to a different view which is a merge
duplicate contacts view this view has a
different concern but i want to recycle
some of that same data so i want to pass
that data over passing data over is not
the same as passing state over i don't
want to throw it over the fence and then
disconnect i want to maintain a
connection and here's the reason this is
why it's unique to mer ing contacts the
user should have the ability to click on
let's say phone number from contact a
email address from contact b so they can
pick these bits of data from each
contact that selection lives in the
parent component but i want to pass it
down to the child so i want to maintain
a live connection so that they can click
it at any time and it will be passed in
so we're sharing state at that point
there are a lot of ways to do this in
react use state use a reducer or context
are built into modern react with hooks
then there are some strange sort of
exotic ways you could do with like next
static props so you could actually
pre-compile the cartisian product of
every two contacts we don't want to do
that that's really weird but there are
some additional built-ins like the
static props that you could do with the
frameworks that are common over and
above react itself and then there are
the state management libraries as well
so there's even more ways to do it keep
it simple that's the first thing you
want to do if a built-in react first way
works you should use it and in this case
a built-in react way does work so let's
focus on those three built-ins use state
use reducer and use context which tool
should we reach for and when and then
which will apply to this case we're
going to be helped out by a few
architectural principles don't repeat
yourself dry the rule of three and the
concept of tight and loose coupling in
general we want to not repeat ourselves
and this is severely indicated once
you've repeated yourself three or more
times two is kind of okay you want to
look at the actual effort and do a
pragmatic return on investment to your
effort if you only repeat yourself twice
that can be fine you can repeat yourself
this is sometimes called you cry you can
repeat yourself the opposite of don't
repeat yourself and how do you navigate
between those you need to actually run
the numbers the return on investment the
rule of three says that typically three
or more times you're going to want to
dry it up and with tight and loose
coupling we typically opt for loose
coupling loose coupling makes things
easier to maintain and update over time
but there is an exception if you want to
break something on purpose so that if
component a changes you want to break
component b or you want to break your
build or you want to throw an error so
that you are quickly and easily alerted
ideally before deploying to production
and that is the case for proper tight
coupling we think about reducers as
middleware so if you want to extract
that repeated logic you can put it in a
reducer we think about context as a data
tree route so it's not as good for
extracting logic it's better for
extracting reusable
data particularly when you have a bunch
of components that have a common
ancestor a great example of this would
be a theme so passing around theme
variables maybe you want light mode dark
mode that's great for ed context used
state is typically for local component
state and there is one exception which
is if you have proper type coupling with
a one-step drill you can use a state
prop in modern react this is pretty much
the only time that you want to use a
state prop you can also use a state prop
as a development tool for a work in
progress implementing a reducer
implementing context might take you a
while so you can temporarily do a state
prop and then clean it up at the end of
your pll request or whatever clean it up
later so these are your three cases when
you want to use state for local state or
for a state prop that only goes one
level deep or for a whip commit in our
case with the merging contacts we are
going one level deep context and
reducers solve a problem called prop
drilling where you have to go through
multiple levels prop drilling is not a
big issue if you're only going one step
so our case here is unique we will
actually reach for use state and the
merge contacts page so you'll view the
duplicates and that duplicate
information which is in the parent will
be passed one step into the merge form
the user will be able to click each
piece of data in the parent component
and it will just get passed in one step
only to the properly tightly coupled
child they're properly tightly coupled
because they're both related to this
contact schema so that if the contact
schema and the parent breaks actually
want to break the child they should
always move in lock step they should be
following the same data shape the same
schema because they're both dealing with
the same entity the same model that is
the contact model so that's called
proper typ coupling and that is pretty
unusual let's wrap up and test
understanding by trying to picture a
scenario that's slightly changed where i
would reach for context or reducer so
one way would be if the merge contact
view were far away if were if it were on
a different page that was not a
descendant component in the rendering
tree then i would probably reach for a
reducer or in that case i might even do
something more exotic like server side
props static props and so on if it was
on a different page i might use context
if there was a hierarchical relation and
that could be that the merge view is
down the tree but it's not a child it's
like a grandchild or a great grandchild
and so on or if it was up the tree so
that there's a hierarchical relation
where they have a common ancestor higher
up so an example of this might be
picture a page where the duplicates are
listed down in one section and there's a
merge form that's actually above that
section not inside of it so the user
would in this case go down to the bottom
and maybe check a few contacts the data
would go up and then down the tree to
kind of like a sibling but they have a
hierarchical ancestor which is the page
itself in that case i would consider
using context on the whole
page this is an advanced topic not a big
deal if you didn't understand it um if
you did understand it and if you have
feedback would love to hear it if you're
interested in coding follow the page and
hope to see you soon

Title: Is Drizzle ORM the new hotness? Nope
Transcript:
five reasons i prefer prisma orm over
drizzle orm in 2023 reason number one
drizzle is a sequel first orn two sub
problems under this number one it
basically defeats the purpose of having
an orm orm's abstract sequel away so you
can just program in your programming
language two by encouraging writing sql
you might end up writing sql which is a
bad security practice reason number two
it's still an alpha contrast this with
prisma which is highly mature reason
number three only four thousand stars on
github contrast that with over 30 000
stars for prisma this is not a vanity
metric this correlates with employer
awareness and industry adoption you want
to know skills that people are actually
going to use you don't want to chase
shiny objects that's reason number four
if everyone's talking about it right now
it just got released always be skeptical
in general of shiny objects number five
prisma is still the default database
client for blitz blitz is tried and true
it handles my whole stack i'm not going
to overturn it for a new unstable shiny

Title: (as a coder) 6 Reasons: Entering My YouTube Era
Transcript:
six reasons i'm entering my youtube era
and you should care if you are following
me to learn to code the last four
reasons will be reasons that you should
go immediately subscribe to me on
youtube if you are a fellow content
creator stay tuned for these first two
reasons and you might consider having
your youtube era the first reason is i
got two strikes on my account so tick
tock creators let's talk about strikes
for a minute the normal rule is three
strikes and your account will be
permanently banned in fact if you have
one really bad strike even one strike
can do it in some cases you can have up
to 10 strikes i've heard and that's very
rare so the normal rule is three strikes
and you're out which would mean that i'm
only one strike away so that's a great
reason for me to pick another platform
the good news is you can appeal these so
i did appeal my robin hood video because
robin hood is not a scam referral link
in the description so the video is
reinstated but the strike stays on your
account for the purpose of the 90-day
windows what's worse you can accumulate
these strikes over time and your account
will not be banned but they will reduce
your views this was unexpected to me and
if this keeps happening it's going to to
kill my views so that's why i need to
look for another platform here's reason
number two is links work better on
youtube so with tick tock they used to
allow pinned comments they used to allow
you to put a link in the comment and
people could click that no more now i
have to tell people to go to my bio and
then i put the referral link in my bio
this isn't just a problem for referral
links if i want to cite something in my
video i have to like put a picture of
the web resource and then ask people to
google it which almost never works it's
way better to go over to youtube and say
the link is in the description it's way
better right by the way my referral link
is in the description
you can get up to 200 of stock at
robinhood check it out so if you're
learning to code you also care about
links you care about verifying and
accessing those sources where the links
are in the description or in the pen
comment youtube is going to be better
for you two is higher quality longer
form content so on tick tock or with
youtube shorts and instagram reels i
could make a series it might be three
four five videos five ten fifteen
seconds each the number of learners that
make it all the way through is very
small and you have to go through and
like find them the ones that are related
right with youtube you have a single
video it's all related it flows straight
through so the total completion rate is
higher and that's good for you as a
student you're going to be actually
learning
three is streams so i've been live
creating this open source tool called
red yellow green and you can see youtube
has the playlist so this is one example
of the live coding playlists that you'll
be able to see if you go over to youtube
so for the next 60 days i'll be in my
youtube era including the shorts so if
you're one of those over 20 000 people
that follows me on tick tock because you
like the coding content in short form
come over to youtube
short videos long videos streams it's
all going to be on youtube whether it's
you or someone you know please consider
sharing if you have a friend who wants
to learn to code or already codes and
just enjoys engaging the culture
please like share and i hope to see you
soon

Title: Building a bot to scrape job data‚Ä¶ How NOT to collect data
Transcript:
so i built a web scraper
that logs into linkedin
searches for jobs in the data science
field
and then scrapes this job description
data
everything was going fine until i woke
up one morning to check on the status of
my bot and found this
so let's go over how i got here and how
you can avoid this
what up dead nerds i'm luke data analyst
and my channel is all about tech and
skills for data science and this video
is part of a series where i'm going
through and building a data science
project in order to build up my
portfolio in my last and also first
video of the series i detail outlining a
problem in order to get started with a
data science project and the problem
that i'm trying to solve that i feel
like many of you can relate to is how to
become a data analyst specifically i
want to have more transparency around
this and i'm going to be looking into
things like what are skills required in
this field and also what is the job
market like so once you know the problem
that you want to solve the next step is
actually collecting the data and
collecting the data can actually come
from a lot of different sources so let's
break this down first is around the
availability of the data is it publicly
available or do we have to sign in some
service or go behind a paywall to access
it and the other major aspect is whether
it's clean or not
if it's clean it's usually in the form
of csvs or a database if it's not so
clean it may be a multitude of data
spread over web pages so i started in
the easiest section looking for clean
publicly available data so the main
sites that i use to look for this kind
of data are sites like kaggle google
data.gov data.world and even some github
locations although there was a lot of
publicly available data around jobs
there wasn't anything that actually
provided the in-depth detail that i
needed to solve my problem so i moved on
to the next section of looking at clean
data that is not necessarily publicly
available and for this i think a good
example are apis so what's an api in
simple terms it involves using some code
such as python to contact a server and
then from there request the data that
you want i consider this not public
because typically an api requires you to
go through some sort of authentication
to approve and allow you to access that
data if you're interested in learning
more about using python to access apis i
highly recommend you check out the
python for everybody course as this
provides an introduction to this so
anyway back to the project i started to
look into top websites that provided job
data and whether they provided apis for
this so i decided to look at some of the
most popular job searching sites that
include linkedin indeed monster
glassdoor and even google jobs out of
all these different websites that i
looked in none of them really had an api
to allow me to collect job data funny
enough linkedin used to actually have an
api to allow you to access this job data
but has since deprecated it it turns out
for good reason they didn't want anybody
building a linkedin competitor all right
the next section we'll look at quickly
is data that is unclean and that is not
publicly available as a data analyst i
find that this is typically where i work
in my normal day job in that i have
access to data if you will on clean data
within my company that's not publicly
available that i have to actually
aggregate and make usable unfortunately
i don't work in linkedin or even google
so this was an option for me so i moved
to the last option and that is data that
is not clean but that is public i like
to think of this as all the publicly
available data on the internet that you
can access through web scraping or web
crawling so for my project i felt that
the best way to solve this problem was
actually collecting job data around job
postings and specifically i looked at
all those websites that i previously
mentioned and i decided to go with
linkedin this is the social media
platform that most of my subscribers are
on when looking for a job so with
linkedin they actually make it really
simple you can go in and search a
specific job title in a specific
location and then get job postings
around this so that's what i decided to
do for this part of the project is build
a web scraper to go in and scrape that
data so over the course of a few days i
worked to build a script for this
purpose since i'm most familiar with
python and feel it's a superior language
i decided to go with this along with
selenium a popular python library truth
be told i'm no expert on web scraping so
initially a lot of my time was spent
learning the basics of web scraping with
data cams course web scraping in python
this course was great at getting me up
to speed fast with the basics of web
scraping and from there once i got into
building the scraper i switched into
using google to answer my questions and
trust me i use google a lot so for the
spot to make it easier to build i broke
it up into sections of logging into
linkedin with my login information
navigating to the job search page and
searching for data analyst jobs going
through and then selecting each job
posting in order to scrape the job data
i wanted once all entries on a page were
cycled through then selecting the next
page and repeating this process for all
remaining pages during this all the data
is being saved to a daily csv file i
wanted only the most recent job postings
so the bot only searched for jobs posted
in the last 24 hours i then used a cron
job to run this script automatically
every night so theoretically i was
scraping all the jobs posted for data
analysts anyway i do want to note some
caveats about web scraping and some
problems that i actually ran into first
i noticed that i had to throttle the
speed that i was actually scraping the
data if i scraped it too fast i would
get those prompts of an ru robot checks
and i actually had to physically check
this in order to continue so because of
this it sometimes took as long as half a
day just to pull all the data that i
wanted the second other limitation was
that linkedin only provides around 1 000
job results with a job search even if
there were hundreds of thousands of job
postings i could only scrape a thousand
jobs at a time and the final most
annoying thing was that i had to log on
to linkedin daily otherwise i would
continue to get the are you a robot
prompt and it would mess up my script so
besides that everything seemed to be
going fine with pulling this data i even
made a video here where i dived into the
initial data that i pulled in order to
find out what skills were being
requested of a data analyst so i was
really optimistic of the data i was
pulling
and i was really hoping to just
continuously pull this data infinitely
into the future so that way i was always
having the most up-to-date data on this
field but one morning when i woke up to
check on the status of my bot and i
noticed that it wasn't pulling data i
initially thought that this was caused
by that third problem that outlined if
not logging in daily so i went and
actually tried to log into linkedin and
when i went to the job postings i
actually physically couldn't search for
jobs anymore
so apparently linkedin identified that i
was a bot and thus restricted my access
to no longer be able to
access job data anymore i was a little
pissed but full disclosure i did use a
burner account so not typically not my
actual linkedin login account i set up a
fake account to actually log in
in case potentially something like this
happened but nonetheless i was still
upset because they had restricted my
access to looking for jobs so i decided
to look more into if web scraping is
legal and i found this 2019 a u.s
circuit court ruled that web scraping
public sites does not violate the law
interesting enough this case was
actually on linkedin being upset that
another company hiq was scraping its
publicly available data the court ruled
that for publicly available
non-copyrighted data users are allowed
to do web scraping however the ruling
excludes those sites that require some
sort of authentication and that have you
sign some sort of terms and conditions
that basically forbid you from doing web
script this year linkedin actually
brought this case up to the supreme
court and it ended up that the ruling
was vacated meaning the ruling was made
legally void
and this case is actually now up for
review again so after learning all this
i decided to look into more of what is
linkedin's terms and conditions on this
and come to find out they actually
specifically ban their members from
scraping any data
probably should have read that first so
where is this project going now that i
hit this road bump well i actually did
find that this job data is available
without you actually logging in or
having to authenticate and agree to
those terms and conditions of linkedin
i'd have to redesign my bot in order to
scrape this publicly available data if
you will and also i'm not sure if i'm
necessarily comfortable doing that just
yet so i'm still thinking about it as
always if you got value out of this
video smash that like button with that

just finished my google final round
these are my reflections on how i think
i did tldr mid but that's also better
than i was expecting because i kind of
thought i was going to bomb so there
were five rounds a behavioral a system
design and then three algorithm
interviews behavioral i think i got it
system design i think i did okay i have
a background in amazon services but it's
a google interview so when i reference
something like a cloud formation instead
of basically getting like automatic
multi-regional failover and stuff for
free i have to like break it down to the
like engine x level um which is a lot
harder three coding interviews one was
like your traditional easy followed by a
hard um i got the easy and then the hard
i got like partly through so my
understanding is that's okay the second
was like a behavioral with a medium did
great on both of those and then the
third was like an easy that grew in
difficulty um and i don't know i think i
did mid like i got partway through i
don't actually know what the expectation
there is so overall i think i did yeah i
think they're going to pass this time i
don't think they hire mid

Transcript:
five elements of an awesome technical
design document as a programmer first
you win an awesome executive summary
that's concise and informative should we
note more than three sentences long it
should describe the business value of
the initiative and who are the
stakeholders both the contributors and
the users second you should have a
thorough background section that goes
through the technical background and the
product background technical background
if i'm updating some code i want to know
what is the existing flow of interest
and i want to know what's the history
here when was this introduced as part of
what feature when did this happen from a
product perspective what are the related
features in their business value and
their stakeholders third talk about your
constraints system performance
constraints solution delivery timeline
constraints third team dependencies
these will also be associated to a risks

but there are a couple other goals one
is like passing an interview so i'll
give you a sample non-algorithmic
interview question right after this
follow for part three where there's
another goal which is passing the
linkedin skill assessments that's also
pretty important sample interview
question goes imagine a blank html page
three buttons two of them are the same
color third is a different color and
four paragraphs that alternate whether
they are bold or not so the question is
give me two different ways to style each
of these components which do you prefer
and why now give me two ways that when i
click the third button that it's a
different color it will toggle the
background color of the whole html page
which of those two implementations you
prefer and why

Title: basically yes im interested in fixing the economy
Transcript:
so when i was in high school my parents
said hey you need to go to college so
that you can get a well-paying job and i
thought oh if the purpose of college is
to get money let's make it a field
related to money so i thought maybe
accounting finance economics business
something like that and then i thought
well accounting is super boring and all
of these other degrees are essentially
subfields of economics so let's go for
economics it's like the top order money
degree so i did that and while i was
studying i said hey i'm kind of good at
this what's better than just improving
my own financial situation is actually
fixing the economy so i double majored
in political science and uh moved up to
dc and i thought i'd be able to like fix
the american economy by contributing to
policy i got there did some political
consulting and realized like no one
cares you have a bachelor's degree so i
went and got a master's in public policy
with an emphasis in fiscal policy from
george mason university
and i talked to some people after i got
the degree and they said hey good job
like we don't care that you have a
master's either you're going to need a
higher degree so i enrolled in the phd
program and about that time i realized i
was sick of politics and i became
persuaded that the political system is
like not progressive and not a good way
to improve social welfare but technology
is and i learned out how to code anyway
because i had built campaign sites
starting with wordpress in my own site
and getting more and more accustomed
until i could just full-on program so i
switched careers into becoming a
programmer
meanwhile i didn't want to drop out of a
phd program so i finished it but i
managed to point the thesis in the
direction of
economics of education in the tech
industry so my thesis is three essays in
post-secondary alternative credentials
with a focus on
certifications in coding boot camps and
so forth and i think it's eventually
going to dovetail i'll be able to
influence the tech
hiring and firing and performance review
process
probably once i get to the director
level or higher that's what i'm still
planning to do and also trying to make
an impact through Ladderly so check out

Title: reduce risk in a gap year
Transcript:
so let's talk about drisking your gap
year you're taking a year to explore a
potential interest in a programming
career you might be a career switcher
like b or like myself congrats b i also
have a background in economics and i
switched over this will work whether
you're a career switcher or maybe you
are a high school graduate you haven't
picked up college yet so we're going to
cover six tips of managing the risk of
your gap year this will be a longer
video in the previous video we talked
about maximizing the value of your gap
year minimizing risk and maximizing
value are not the same thing what is the
goal of your gap year the goal is to
understand whether you do have that
interest in programming whether you have
a technical knack and possibly even
landing a job that's a different
objective compared to managing risk
managing risk is minimize the chance of
failure or in the case of failure
minimize the cost of that failure we're
going to talk about uh direct cost and
then given my background in economics
i'm going to be talking about
opportunity cost as well very important
first tip we'll start with a simple one
define your goal your plan and your
reason why write them on a piece of of
paper physically write it and get an
accountability partner that you tell
this to verbally this is good old
motivation hacking it works for a
variety of reasons writing it down just
helps you remember making you think
through the plan helps you write a
better plan making you communicate it to
another person forces a feedback loop
where you write a better plan and then
social incentives kick in where you want
to look good to this person and you will
just have a little bit more skin in the
game plus if you're not that serious
about it you won't even go through with
this step and you'll be able to fail
fast which is actually a really great
thing in cutting risk
tip two relates to b so b switched from
sales and you might switch from any
other industry which means you might
have a current employer tip two is
leverage your employer educational
benefit did you know if you work at
walmart you can go to college for a
dollar a day that's cutting so much risk
because you're spending so much less
program details vary here ask your
manager and check your company policy
does the tuition benefit apply to a
coding boot camp or an online course and
that brings us to tip three don't pick a
random coding boot good camp or a random
online course pick a highquality one
that begs the question how do we know
it's a high quality one well i have the
answer for you i have a phd and
economics where i studi this stuff go to
cours report.com sort the coding boot
camps by most reviewed and you need to
pick a coding boot camp that is in your
location in your country and has a score
of 4.25 or higher on the five point
scale and more than 400 reviews or a
fortune 50 learning provider like google
meta amazon microsoft and so on these
are called prestigious coding boot camps
and prestigious learning providers and
they are significantly correlated to
your h ability outcomes your labor
market outcomes because surprise high uh
employers know about these people
employers know about these people so is
it really any surprise that they're like
oh like we know amazon like we trust
them and so then you'll have a better
job search outcome a random coding boot
camp is not even correlated to job
search performance so don't pick a
random online course don't pick like a
youtube video where the guy calls it a
boot camp camp you need to go to cours
report.com and follow the prescribed
method to find a prestigious or a highly
reputed coding boot camp tip four is go
beyond these correlated reputation
mechanisms that correlate with getting a
job and get a straightup job guarantee
at the time of recording springboard in
the united states is a learning provider
that has a job guarantee highly
encourage you to check out springboard
or browse through boot camps that have
this high reputation and look in
particular for a job guarantee again if
you go to course report.com
should make a note of that on the
learning provider details page i told
you i'm going to give you six tips i'm
actually going to give you seven sorry
about that hope that's okay stay to the
end i guess the last one is awesome i'm
supposed to say that right you got to
stay all the way to the end so that like
the algorithm loves me the truth is even
a coding boot camp even if it has a job
guarantee is a large commitment for some
people so let's drisk that even further
you should sign up at Ladderly dot io and
Ladderly gives you a stepbystep checklist
so this is the drisking tool is use a
structured checklist
that will help you kick off your
portfolio right away and you will get
your feet wet coding and you'll be able
to determine whether or not you like
coding so with the Ladderly dot io
checklist one of the items is going to
be check out free code camp or code
academy and these are semi-formal online
courses they're not really in-depth
they're not going to get you a job but
they're a good way to get your feet wet
with some semi-structured learning and
if you take these and if you're like
yeah this is really easy i want to like
do the more serious stuff now you've got
a really green flag to dive into one of
those boot camps
if you take these and you're like i
can't even get through html and css like
it's so bad that's like maybe you
shouldn't be doing a coding boot camp
for html and css Ladderly is going to
further help you drisk because there's a
discord with a bunch of people on there
and you can social network social
networking has reinforcement for
motivation but it also just improves
your job search because now like you
know people um having social connections
on linkedin or whatever is going to
improve your job search that's another
kind of drisking prestigious coding boot
camp was tip four drisk risking the
coding boot camp investment itself with
Ladderly and free code camp that was
all tip five here's tip six this doesn't
apply to very many people but it's going
to be really important for those that it
does apply to and that is don't wait
until you graduate if you're considering
a gap year after graduation maybe you're
a sophomore right now why don't you just
try coding like over the summer or if
you have the spare time and i realize
not everyone does because of
extracurriculars but if you have the
spare time why don't even you just try
like coding over some weekends so you
can knock out the code academy or free
code camp stuff uh before you even
graduate high school and you'll have a
really good signal at that point you'll
have a really good idea am i ready to
dive into a boot camp immediately or not
if you get a score less than three it's
a red flag for a gap year it doesn't
mean you're not smart enough it has to
do with conscientiousness work ethic the
ability to self-motivate self-start and
stick to a plan if you get a score over
four that's a green flag and if you're
between three and four it's sort of a
yellow flag it's still moderate risk
self-studying is hard less than 5% of
people that try to become a pr
programmer on their own just by going
through youtube videos and online
courses will be
successful coding boot camps have a
higher success rate but coding boot
camps are really intense and rigorous if
you go to a good one and if you don't go
to a good one it's not going to help you
get a job so the truth is if you get a
grit score less than three college might
be an ideal fit for you because it's a
bit slower paced and it's just a better
fit for some people if you enjoyed the

Title: Learn React not C
Transcript:
four reasons most people want to learn
react not c plus plus one c plus plus is
low level that makes you deal with
difficult concepts like memory
management react is high level and it's
also multi-use so you can do a lot of
stuff with it websites mobile games and
so on two c plus plus is most commonly
used in the gaming industry which among
programming circles is known for poor
work-life balance and low maximum salary
even late into your career building on
the point about salary 92k out of the
gate for react and 90k for c plus plus
this is not late into your career this
is out of the gate so they're comparable
but one is more work for less money
before you get paid you got to get a job
66 000 jobs available for c plus plus
twice that many for react developers by
the time you know react you also know
javascript so you're going to be able to
tap multiple job opportunities follow my
channel and i'll give you a list of the
many job titles that are available to
you if you do know react bonus reason
number five from a stack overflow survey
link in the description more purple than
blue means even experienced developers

search one linkedin is now prioritizing
candidates to recruiters when those
candidates engage with the linkedin
platform and they are responsive to
recruiter inmails two linkedin is now
prioritizing candidates that are
socially connected with employees of the
company where the technical recruiter is
working how do you take advantage of
this be active in growing your social
network get those connections they mean
something number three this is not an
update but it was news to me and that is
that linkedin prioritizes candidates
that use the open to work profile status
so set that status if you're looking for
a job and then number four tap the

Title: Python for DevOps?
Transcript:
this user says python for devops i agree
but it's not really clear-cut let me
give you a few reasons why core skills
and devops are going to be docker and
bash and also infrastructure setting up
infrastructure in some cloud environment
often aws if you have those many
companies don't care what programming
language you have a background in but
they do care that you have some
programming background so i don't think
any juniors should be going directly
into devops it's really hard to
understand what's going on if you have
no technical background so devops i see
is an intermediate to senior plus role
where usually you have some junior
experience programming something
here you can see devops engineer it is a
specialty so the job count is kind of
low look at this top result here's the
skills for the top result willing to do
the job and learn they specify
technologies like docker and aws
infrastructure but they don't specify a
language it's really common not to
specify a language for devops i went
through the top 10 on indeed four
specified some languages one was only
javascript three were like python or
ruby or java

Transcript:
there is an index that actually tracks
the popularity of languages pgt thanks
for suggesting the tyobi index i love
the data-driven approach there was no
information for me so i checked it out
but i had a really negative experience i
think on javascript it matches a bunch
of wrong keywords it doesn't match for
react angular ecmascript es6 a bunch of
other things like that we'd be searching
for so what i'd recommend people do
instead is look to the stack overflow
developer survey which is like a really
common reference anyway
and i think there you'll see that the
answer is learn react not python
and yes of course the optimal technology
for your project depends on your project
requirements but we need an intelligent
default for people who are just starting
out they're overwhelmed with options
again javascript has platform
flexibility

Title: Learn Redux in 3 Minutes
Transcript:
learn react part five let's talk about
redux redux is a global state manager
that uses a special data structure
called a store to manage state in native
react every component has its own state
when we talk about application state
what we're really talking about in
native react is properties being passed
from parent to child and possibly from
the very top level component all the way
down to the very bottom level component
a problem occurs because if i am in a
particular child component and i have
some error with some state that's coming
from my parent i don't know if it came
from my immediate parent my grandparent
or an ancestor far up the tree
potentially all the way to the top this
makes debugging really hard it's also
not ergonomic for developers to pass
states sideways or oblique through the
state tree or the component tree redux
solves all these problems with a global
state container called a store
components directly speak with the store
and now debugging is easy you or just
getting your state from your store and
you can always just go right there and
debug it you can choose to manage state
globally with a global object just an
object on the windows scope redux
instead uses a store which is an object
light data structure that includes
functions to read and write data and
it's also immutable how do you read and
write data to an immutable object
technically you can't so we don't call
these functions getters and setters we
call them selectors and reducers
the reducer is actually a special
factory function whenever you run a
reducer function it creates a whole new
store and replaces the previous one it
does not update the previous one by
reference a selector selects values out
very much just like a getter function
selectors and reducers are two kinds of
functions you can run on the store in
general we just call them actions
there's a third catch-all term which is
middleware so you can do selector
reducer in middleware using an immutable
object that's replaced completely works
well with reacts change detection it
also enables features like time
traveling because we can keep track of
the transactions that is those functions
which update the store and result in
replacement of the store again really
good for debugging because the store is
constantly being replaced we can't
maintain a buy reference relationship we
need to maintain a by value relationship
that's why selectors are functions you
can select out the value on any instance
and all of these actions selectors
reducers and middleware are run in a
queue and it's basically a callback
queue and to place your function into
the queue we call that dispatching so
you're going to dispatch an action and
all that means is that you're going to
place one of these functions in a queue
and it's going to run on the normal
react change detection life cycle and
that's it you now know the basics of
redux you can create your own global
object and use object.freeze and you'll
basically have a store the only
difference is you won't have those redux
specific function names to replace your
store but it's really very much doing
the same thing last thing i would
mention here is that there's one super
special kind of middleware which is
called a thunk callback functions are
usually synchronous but the thunk will
allow you to have an async callback so
you can do http requests and cache the
results in your store

Title: PUT YO TOKENS IN THE AIRRRR
Transcript:
let's talk about jason webb tokens in my
bathroom visit jwt.io if you want to
review the spec and get more technical
but basically a json web token is a
string that has a subsection that can be
trivially decoded using base64. what
data does it contain when you decode it
the answer is whatever you want it's
commonly used for sessions but there's
no reason you can't put other stuff in
there jwe is an encrypted json web token
this is a great practice if you want to
put email or other sensitive information
inside of the token you can encrypt it
assigned jwt is another secure practice
that can be used in conjunction with or
apart from encryption you can even sign
tokens that aren't jwts like database
tokens using a sign token allows your
server to verify that the token
originated from a server that has access
to the secret key a signed token is
often used to verify server authenticity
you can use a csrf token totally
different token to verify client
persistence as opposed to like a man in
the middle stateless sessions in session
forwarding are two cool features you can
do with these tokens my favorite option
is the encrypted version

Title: Leetcode Mastery??
Transcript:
so this is in response to brandon j peck
who stated that big tech companies value
algorithm interviews because they signal
conformity conscientiousness or grit and
iq and i agree with that you don't have
to have very high iq but it does signal
satisfaction of a threshold what i
wanted to add there is that these
credentials are not necessary for lower
to mid-tier employment prospects this is
specifically for big tech and for
advanced skill sets by that time
everyone has the basics down and you
need a really difficult indicator to
separate between a bunch of really good
people and like the really top top one
percent mastering algorithm interviews
is not necessary if you're switching
into career into programming for a
junior to mid-level role that's what i
wanted to add thanks

so if you're a modern web developer vs

webstorm is the ide you use if you're a

development microsoft owns vs code they
develop typescript typescript is like
the gold standard in front of language
now but let's give some data
stack share vs code has over 10x
followers
slant.co has about 5x vs code responses
the ratio is roughly equal maybe
slightly better for vs code g2 and other
common software comparison website has
the review rating approximately equal on
average but about 3x the responses for
vs code so vs code is a lot more popular
it's also not only free but open source
so you can customize it to your own
liking webstorm of course is closed
source so yeah i've worked at capital

Title: Tech Behavioral Interview Example Answer
Transcript:
so tell me about a time that you solved
a problem using logic thanks for the
question so echoing back the question it
was tell me about a time where i solved
a problem using logic so two key words
that stuck out to me there are problem
and logic and so to me this sounds more
like a story where i did some
troubleshooting or i fixed a bug instead
of one where i just like implemented a
new feature requirement so when i think
about logic obviously programming every
day
um maybe a more interesting case of
logic is like math and then how does
math relate to programming one way is uh
telemetry or metrics like monitoring and
stuff so i'm going to tell you about a
time where i had to debug a production
issue using telemetry how i solved it
made sure it never happened again so you
know previously when i worked at a
different company i got this production
outage notification on pagerduty went
into splunk did some debugging and found
out what component that was associated
with was able to narrow a window pin it
to a release solve that issue and add
some tests to ruin it from happening
again

Title: how a sr picks an application starter
Transcript:
great question let me show you how an
experienced engineer thinks to this
question the first place you go is the
official documentation search here we
see these installation instructions
there's a bit of a problem here already
because we want to think backwards from
how we are going to deploy and this
requires us to use a traditional
long-lived server as opposed to a
serverless function this is where
sometimes as a senior developer you just
know things and so i just know that
versel is like the place to go today so
if you need runtime server-side logic
i'd recommend the dino runtime from
purcell but maybe you don't need runtime
server-side logic maybe you can build a
static site and deploy it on github
pages you're going to be using github
for your repository anyway right dino is
really strong at this you can see three
projects they're all three good i would
go for the top one first because it's
official from dino itself if you click
the top link they even provide a github
action for you that'll build your site
whenever you push up to your github

Title: How To Install SuperAGI - Multiple Agents, GUI, Tools, and more!
Transcript:
this is super agi it's essentially auto
gpt on steroids it can use tools it can
run multiple agents in parallel it has a
graphical user interface it's super easy
to install and they're adding new
functionality every single day welcome
back in today's video i'm going to show
you how to install super agi and also
how to use it it has a lot of
functionality i'm going to show you
around some of it and then i encourage
you to play around with it let's go so
this is the github repo for super agi
it's by transformer optimus and it's
currently on github trending it has a
lot of functionality let's review some
of it really quick and then i'm going to
get into the installation guide so first
obviously you can provision spawn and
deploy autonomous ai agents a couple
things that it does better than auto gpt
is the fact that you can extend it with
a bunch of different tools right out of
the box it also has a graphical user
interface and you can run agents
concurrently here are some of the tools
that it has so slack email google search
github zapier instagram and it's all
wrapped up in a docker image so it's
super easy to install let me show you
how to do that the first thing you're
going to need to do is get docker so go
to docker.com download docker install it
and then have it up and running this is
what it looks like and you could just
keep that on in the background next
we're going to open a visual studio code
then we're going to click this little
button in the top right that says toggle
panel that'll open up our terminal
within visual studio code next on the
repo page we're going to click this
little green code button and then we're
going to copy the url once the terminal
opens up we're going to type cd change
directory and change to our desktop from
there we're going to type git clone and
then paste that url that we just copied
hit enter and that'll clone it to our
desktop then we're going to come up to
this explorer icon we're going to click
it we're going to click open folder and
then we're going to select super agi and
click open then again in the top right
we're going to toggle panel so that'll
open up our terminal and while that's
opening the next thing we're going to do
is right click on config underscore
template.yaml and we're going to rename
it and we're just going to rename it
fig.yaml and that's where we're going to
store all our environment variables so
this is where you're going to put your
pine cone key your openai key your
google key everything anything else that
you want to use this is where you put it
so for example if you want to use email
you can do it from here today we're just
going to be using open ai pinecone and
google search the next thing you're
going to do is create an api key with
open ai so if you don't already have an
account sign up for openai then navigate
to
platform.openai.com account slash
api-keys we're going to click create new
key right here we're going to name it
super2 because i already have a super
then i'm just going to say create secret
key i'm going to copy it and don't worry
i'm going to revoke all of these keys
before publishing this video then i'm
going to come back to the repo
specifically the config.yaml file i'm
going to find the open ai key right
there and i'm going to paste it and save
the next thing we need is a pine cone
api key so if you're using a free
pinecone account you can only have one
index at a time i've already created one
so i'm going to go ahead and delete it
and then on the left over here we're
going to click api keys i'm going to
click create new api key and then enter
the key name i'm going to call it super2
again create key i'll copy the key value
we're going to switch back to visual
studio code and then at the very top it
says your pinecone api key we're going
to paste over that but we also need the
pinecone environment so if i switch back
this is the pinecone environment right
there i'm going to copy that as well and
i'm going to paste it and save the next
thing we're going to do is get the
google api key so you're going to come
to google cloud services right here
under api and services click it now i
already have one called super agi so i'm
just going to use that again but if you
don't you're going to click this and
create a new project then up here you
can search for different resources so
you're going to type custom search api
and then under marketplace it says
custom search api you're going to go
ahead and click that manage create
credentials and then you're just going
to say custom search api right there
we're going to use the application data
option and no we're not using any of
these then you click next then from here
we're going to type super agi it's going
to create the service account id
automatically or can generate it and
then you can have a description but you
don't need it create and continue select
a role this is optional we're going to
skip over that and then grant users
access to this account and we don't need
to do that either so i click done then
on the left side we're going to click
credentials at the top we're going to
click create credentials and we need an
api key it's creating one now i'm going
to copy that close it we're going to
switch back to the config.yaml file and
we're going to place it right here over
the google api key then save the last
thing we need is the search engine id
and you're going to get that from this
programmable search engine website it's
kind of weird that you need this but you
do and i'm going to drop all these links
in the description below so from here
click get started i already have one
super agi but if you didn't you're going
to click add you can add a search engine
name and then just create it it's pretty
straightforward but we're going to use
our existing one super agi right there
and then we need this search engine id
i'm going to copy it we're going to
switch back to the config.yaml file and
place that right there click save now we
we have everything we need now to
install super agi we need to do two
things with docker the first thing we
need to do is type docker dash compose
up dash dash build and then hit enter
and that's going to build everything
from our repository and again you do
need docker up and running for this to
work the nice thing about docker is
you're likely not going to run into any
of the python versioning issues the
module missing issues that i know so
many of you ask about i run into that
every single time so it's really nice
that the engineers put this together
okay this is what it looks like when
it's up and running then the last thing
we've got to do is just go to localhost
so go to your browser type localhost
colon 3000 and then hit enter and there
it is here's super agi this is what a
fresh install looks like when you first
get started so we're going to go over to
this agents tab right here we're going
to click create agent i'm going to say
this is a test agent we do need a
description so testing and then we can
add one or many goals here so we're
going to say research ai topics for
youtube videos that's the only goal that
i'm going to give it and if you have
gpt4 api access you can select it here
but if not you can always go with gpt
3.5 turbo so i'm going to go with turbo
for now because it's really fast and
here is where you select the tools so
these are the tools that super agi has
to use let's look at them read email
send email append file delete file the
one that we definitely want is google
search read file and write file
everything else i encourage you to play
around with and find what works for you
it also gives us some advanced options
but i'm not going to go through that now
and the nice thing is super agi seems to
figure out what tools it needs as it
goes then we click this button create
and run and it starts there it's
thinking it has all of the details of
this agent and again the nice thing is
you can have multiple agents running in
parallel now if you want to see a little
bit more information about what's going
on switch back to visual studio code and
you can actually look through the logs
of what it's doing alright there it goes
so i am a test agent my role is testing
it gives a whole bunch of information i
think this is all the prompts and if we
scroll down here's the next thing it's
going to do determine which next command
to use and respond using the format
specified above thoughts to achieve my
goal i should start by performing a
google search to find relevant ai topics
here's a google search returned and then
it gives us a bunch of information
returned from the google search and
it'll continue on here's the next
thought i should save the relevant
information to a file for future
reference plan save the ai topics to a
file so it automatically grabs the tool
write file and it wrote it to a file
called ai underscore topics dot txt
really really cool and it thinks it's
finished since i have completed my goal
of researching ai topics for youtube
videos i should use the finish command
it also includes criticism just like
auto gpt does so it's thinking and then
also criticizing its own thoughts and
planning around those criticisms so
that's super agi now you know how to
install it and run it play around with
it let me know what you think if you
have any questions feel free to jump in
our discord i'm happy to answer
questions there and let me know what you
build with super agi if you like this
video please consider giving a like can

so you decide to learn to code awesome
do you need a mentor
um actually you don't but i'm going to
argue that even though you don't need it
it could still be a really great idea so
how do mentors add value i'm going to
argue in a couple ways we know there's
like the social way right where they can
connect you to people that they know are
hiring give your referral give you a
reference help you prep for that
interview i think another way is that
mentors actually help you learn better
let's compare you going to free code
camp by yourself versus with a mentor by
yourself you're not really sure which
certificate to take so you have to knock
them all out that's like thousands of
hours of work a good mentor would tell
you you only need the top three and even
those have some sections you can skip
like the javascript frameworks one has a
section on jquery you really don't need
that so we save you time which adds
value to you but more importantly we can
accelerate and decelerate as needed
tailored to you let's say you get stuck
on a place in free code camp if it's you
by yourself you're just beating your
head against the wall reading the same
text over and over a good mentor will
help the concept click by reframing the
same concept in different contexts did
you know that the free codecamp
curriculum is dated a good mentor or
what

Title: College Degree is NEVER worth it!! üò°üò°
Transcript:
is it worth getting a bachelor software
engineering degree no it is never worth
getting a degree for computers hey big
respect to dev slopes i like what they
do on youtube i follow them gotta
disagree in this case because the word
never is too strong there are cases
where the degree helps by the way i have
a phd in economics and this is my
dissertation topic so google my name
john vandevere and google scholar so
getting a degree will improve your high
rate passing interviews and so forth
it's not needed but it will improve your
higher rate so if you can pay a low
enough price the return on investment is
there here's a great price you can play
zero dollars walmart guild education
partnership you get a computer science
degree for zero dollars if you're at
least a part-time associate
so that's definitely worth it
um it's true you can just go to a boot
camp i'd probably prefer a effective
boot camp to the average american degree
but if you can get a deal on it that's a
great way to go

Title: Interviews: STAR Method Tools!!
Transcript:
i just got done with a four hour stream
making a basic react application here's
the name below starboy part two check it
out if you want to learn how a basic
react application works including
deployment to github pages anecdote
organizer based on the star method that
major tech companies will use for their
behavioral interviews the idea here is
that it's almost like a flash card
application to help you remember all of
the key points of your anecdotes and to
practice telling that story pretty
simple stuff we got three buttons up at
the top you can add a new anecdote card
you see i click that and it'll put a
blank one up there for me i can click in
here and fill it out i can import an
anecdote json file and then after i make
whatever edits i make i can export that
and save it so it's using your local
computer instead of like a database
somewhere else so if that interests you
if you want to learn how to code destroy
that like button like i upvoted these
guys give it back to the community
follow my channel i'll see you around

Title: YOUR RESUME: FIXEDüí™üí™
Transcript:
three major keys to land your next
interview follow my channel if you want
to learn to code but this information
will apply even outside of the it
industry your resume is a tool to get
your next interview and the enemy of
your resume is the applicant tracking
system indeed.com knows how to beat the
ats because they built it so twenty
dollars for their resume review is an
absolute steal they'll give you feedback
to improve your resume if it's hard for
you to incorporate that feedback don't
worry they'll rewrite the resume for you
for an additional fee now that you got a
rock solid resume it's time for major
key 2 which is to blast that resume out
two birds with one stone indeed.com can
help you do that i also like the
ladders.com in the lower left and
linkedin jobs major key 3 is social
follow-up use linkedin to directly
message somebody that works at the
company to which you just applied
hopefully a recruiter you can ask them
for an informational interview you can
ask them to review your resume low
effort thing most people will be happy
to engage that conversation with you if
this helped like the video leave a
comment have a great day

it is not so very important for a person
to learn facts for that he does not
really need a college he can learn them

Title: Frontend Big Tech Interviews
Transcript:
this is a great question with front and
style interview we mean using front-end
technologies basically web technologies
and the emphasis here is really just
going to be javascript specific
experience i had at facebook i was asked
to implement basically topological sort
although they give they didn't say that
but um as you work through the problem
you figured out that you were trying to
topologically sort promises
so promises are specific to javascript
the implementation
using crutch api was javascript specific
it involved dom elements sometimes
you'll get problems with dom elements
and they'll often be your standard dsna
leak code stuff kind of in disguise so
you might have string manipulation array
manipulation sorting problems but you'll
be using constructs that are sort of
like front-end constructs like the dom
um dom fragments promises stuff like
that i would say my general advice these
days is for big tech like don't do the
front install interview i think they're
actually harder

Title: Pick JavaScript!
Transcript:
so if you ask me to pick one language a
new developer should learn i'm going to
pick javascript and the react framework
on top of that this graphic from slash

highlights a couple reasons for that but
you can also see it's a simplification
if your goal is data science maybe you
want a different language

builder tom thanks for the question so
react is just a rendering library blitz
is a opinionated full stack framework so
bliss is going to do things like routing
for you out of the box in an opinionated
way blitz is a framework on top of
next.js one of the unique opinions about
blitz is that it uses react query as
opposed to redux for state management
and uh like caching and http requests
and stuff like that blitz also includes
prisma and typescript out of the box so
here's the website check it out at the
top we can see flight control that's
another thing to mention blitz has its
own infrastructure that is purpose built
to host blitz that's a work in progress
but it's called flight control it's
going to be sort of like versel or
railway but specifically for blitz and
at the bottom we can see import zod so
that's another thing to mention so uh
blitz is also opinionated about your
react form library so that's another
thing that you don't have to pick it
comes picked for you recommend you
follow brandon aka flybear on twitter
big fan of the guy

five things you can do to optimize your
linkedin page to get coding interviews
this is part two out of a three-part
series lane coding interviews peep the
caesars palace window view
number one have a social network behind
you work with recruiters recruiters your
friend career services from your boot
camp that's fine or a mentor like me
they will review it and go through a
checklist make sure that you have all of
your skills listed wording in your
summary things like that number two take
the linkedin assessments and pass them
html css javascript and react
we know that you're going to pass
because you already took the free code
academy course or free code camp or
codecademy and you already took the
pluralsight skill iq and you did well
number three make sure that your summary
is well worded and matches job
descriptions for web developer number
four make sure you have a nice profile
picture and use your background picture
to advertise for you as well fifth and
final tip is to have your own website on
github pages that links to your linkedin
and all of your other social media
thanks for watching

Title: Learn HTML pt 1/5
Transcript:
html part 105 you can learn the basics
in half an hour at the top doctype
simply tells your browser or other
program that this file is an html file
to the right of html is a character
called a chevron or an angle bracket
there are left and right chevrons left
and right angle brackets when you have
them together that's called a tag so at
the top that is a dot type tag some tags
are self-closing some tags open and
close and contain information like the
h1 contains my first heading that's the
heading it contains it and then it
closes it you know it's closed tag
because it has a slash there you might
think hey it's an html file why do i
have an html tag well in an html file
you can put javascript css and other
stuff inside of it so that html
indicates that this is actually html in
your html as opposed to javascript in
your html file last key part here body
and head are the two main sections of
any html document body is what shows on
screen to the user head which is not
here would contain metadata like the
page title that would be used for like
google searches and stuff

bro how tiny is my head right now let's
talk about my interview process at three
different vegan companies your mileage
may vary all of these companies had a
three-step interview process culminating
in a loop or power day that was like a
series of four to five interviews in the
same day doing the second step as a
hacker rank algorithm interview was
pretty common i think faces was the
nicest they even rescheduled once
because i was like really stressed out
and they said take a little more time i
want you to feel comfortable with hard
level elite code or algo expert
difficulty problems to get through these
twitter i got all the way to the final
the final i got an algorithm question i
solved it but i didn't solve it
optimally and that was enough to fail me
amazon is a lot more random i actually
got through their final round with an
optimal solution and they still failed
me they have this rule where if they
don't agree that a new hire will raise
the bar by like 50 then they don't hire
you even if you did well and amazon also
has a policy where they won't give you
feedback and tell you specifically what
went wrong amazon also has like weird
cooldown periods so one time they gave
me a zero month a six month and then a
two year cool down

Title: From Jr to Mid Frontend Dev
Transcript:
so what are the signs of an advanced
front-end developer this is part two in
the previous video i described that like
the ultimate developer is actually full
stack but if i'm a junior and i'm
wanting to progress to intermediate
there are definitely some concrete steps
i can take so junior will know html css
and some javascript including something
about one of the three major frameworks
intermediate developer will know more
javascript including maybe multiple
frameworks being able to compare and
contrast frameworks is really great
being able to compare and contrast
rendering modes client-side rendering
server-side rendering static generation
that's an asset for an intermediate
developer and also knowing more of a
single framework including the
surrounding ecosystem so not just
knowing react but knowing apollo or
graphql or react query
and understanding like when you would
want to use each one of these
intermediate developers are going to be
a little more full stack they're going
to have better testing and performance
optimization knowledge on the front end
specifically they're also going to have
better accessibility knowledge and seo

Title: Three Lesser-Known Tech Job Boards
Transcript:
three lesser known places for you to
find your next tech job we all know
about indeed jobs we all know about
linkedin jobs and the importance of
social networking on linkedin you might
end up cold dming a hiring manager they
may or may not be responsive or
expecting that our first alternative
cord builds on that and they empower you
as the job candidate because it is a
social messaging platform where they
sign up and they're expecting dms from
the jump so it'll always be warm they'll
always be expecting that and they're
actually graded on their responsiveness
this is not just hiring managers you're
dming sometimes you'll straight up dm a
cto or something it's really cool stay
to the end the last one i didn't even
know about until today but before i
continue make sure to like and subscribe
also subscribe my youtube link in bio
where i live stream code hired.com is
cool because you apply once and you do
your algorithm interviews on there and
if you pass you get a warm intro and an
expedited interview process at a lot of
different companies all at once they
also have transparent pay before you
even interview skillgigs.com try this
out let me know your thoughts and this
one employers will bid on you creating a
pipeline of warm job opportunities

look i get it being a woman and trying
to find a job in this damage ladies who
want to code five tips in under a minute
one realize by wanting to code you
already have a huge advantage and a lot
of these academic and statistical
results don't even apply to you two
here's one of like a thousand papers on
this topic one of the reasons men land a
lot of these roles is basically because
they're overconfident and assertive like
during their interview so we can
actually do something called
assertiveness training just google that
this can actually help even if you're a
guy if you're low confidence three there
are a ton of like really vibrant
communities that are striving
specifically to empower women in coding
so girls who code.com is like a really
great one look these up on google or
target a pro diversity employer so
facebook apple google you're tier one
but also a bunch of tier two and no name
companies will have diversity
initiatives where they're specifically
seeking to empower like underrepresented
groups whether that's women minorities
low income so target these employers at
interview time ask if they have that
program they'll help you out number five
you guessed it like the video follow me
i'm mentor people with all kinds of
backgrounds and i've helped women
advance their career in tech

Transcript:
taylor says linkedin moved from
connecting with people to following
people you need to try to connect with
people because if you follow someone
they did not see your content if you
connect with someone they automatically

Title: Structured Job Searches Give You Conversion Data
Transcript:
having a structured job search means
you're following a repeatable
standardized pattern it's going to let
you perform analysis without bias so
your job search is going to follow a
funnel like this you're going to submit
an application then you should be in
communication with a recruiter you
should have some interviews and then
second stage interviews and then finally
get to an offer just by outlining that
structure some of y'all are going to go
wow after i submit my resume i actually
don't socially follow up with a
corporate recruiter so just identifying
that missing gap is one benefit so now
you can measure conversion rates in your
funnel given that i submitted the resume
what are my chances that i'm going to go
in for an interview given that i went
into an interview what are my chances
that i get an offer you're going to be
able to calculate this over time and so
then i can say okay this is how much
time it takes to submit a resume so this
is how many offers i can get in this
reasonable amount of time for my clients
what i recommend is that they do 200
applications in the first month so
that's 50 a week each week that will
usually get them three to ten interviews
and one to three offers

Title: Best Agency for Content Creators?
Transcript:
i want to stream from my computer to
tick tock lives and my understanding is
i need an agency to get stream keys so i
want to take you through my thought
process of how i'm finding the agency
that i'm going to sign up with so first
i just go to google and i search best
tick tock agencies and i scroll past the
sponsored
i'm looking at basically all the
articles on this first page
and i want to see agencies that are
repeatedly mentioned like across the
board so like here's five here's seven
here's ten they all have their opinions
do they have any in common
then i did another search with different
words tick tock content creator agency
just to see if different words get me
like different results but sorry google
is trying to like make me search by
location which i don't want and i
couldn't really figure out how to turn
it off easily so i went over to a
different search engine duckduckgo which
is kind of a nice idea anyway because
it'll get rid of that google bias right
so across my searches six links kept
popping up one's not on here because it
was behind a paywall from business
insider and the remaining five two of
them i would call like buyer oriented
and none of the agencies that they
mention are repeated between these two
and what i mean by buyer is like a
company wants to buy social media
services and it's that kind of an agency
and then these three i would call this
like creator oriented where as a creator
you go sign up with a talent agency kind
of like and so that's these three
and so i'm going to tally up what's
repeated i'm already noticing viral
nation i need to go through the rest of
them but another thing i'm noticing
is that they put these in categories
like this is best overall this is good
for analytics
and if you scroll down you'll see
um one is like good for luxury brands
and so a bunch of these are going to be
repeated possibly and i still won't want
them or best for gaming it's this gaming
and tech but basically like i'm not a
gaming creator i'm not a luxury brand
creator
so my original solution of just look for
what's repeatedly recommended i might
need to modify that okay so the highest
score that you could get would be three
if you're mentioned in all three of
these uh creator oriented articles
and so here are my top five they all
have a score of three and then
ubiquitous in addition to having a score
of three was named best for creators
so that comes in at number one and then
these four are not necessarily ordered i
wanted to narrow it down to just three
but i couldn't find any really good
reasons to rule out the others you see
audiencely is germany based which
i debated if that's gonna like distract
from my focus because i am us oriented
like i don't i don't speak german right
i'm not interested in german marketing i
have a us consumer base
but they have a global focus and then i
thought maybe i want to
remove points for that but the problem
is it's like
all of these top ones are globally
focused based or like globally focused
even if they're us-based so
um i think they're just all in the top
five and i'm going to end up talking to
all of them
so yeah here are my top five ubiquitous
is my favorite here's another thing that
i almost dinged off points for which is
influencer marketing hub three of them
are like sponsored they pay
so if anything that's another point for
ubiquitous that they are not paying and
they still got up here but it's also a
point for
audiencely however
it's really not obvious to me that i
should take a point off because these
people are paying for sponsorship
because they may still at the end of the
day be the biggest brands with the most
opportunities and so i'm just gonna get
more information from all five of these
and we'll see where it goes from here

Title: A true data science mindset is utterly foreign to most programmers
Transcript:
do software engineers need to have a
data science mindset nowadays this is a
question i got during one of my live
coding streams the answer is a
resounding no data science is a mindset
of probability when it comes to
programming we are not thinking in terms
of probabilities we are thinking
inductively and deductively we want
guarantees that certain things are going
to happen when certain logic triggers
when we're troubleshooting or doing a
root cause analysis we also want to
follow a deductive or inferential
mindset not a probabilistic mindset this
will be your guidance at the junior and
mid level at the senior level you will
start to encounter probability again
this will have to do with things like
traffic patterns then you're going to
want to be able to correlate bugs to
traffic patterns you don't need to worry
about those things at the junior level
if you are capable of having both of
these mindsets and toggling between them
correctly that's going to be a huge
benefit but don't have that standard in
mind for other software engineers very
few people can do that so when you're
thinking about their mindset most
programmers will have a deductive
nonprobabilistic mindset that's going to
help you with communication

Title: Java vs JavaScript
Transcript:
alex thanks for the question there are a
ton of differences i'll just give you
three and before i start let me say that
this is one of those brightline tests
that programmers use to determine
whether or not you're like a programmer
or not so non-technical folks get this
mixed up all the time another one of
these brightline tests would be saying
html is a programming language which
it's not so html stands for hypertext
markup language so it's a language right
and it's a language used by programs
therefore it's a programming language
right actually no and so that's
something that a lot of non-technical
people think but programmers know it's
not touring complete so it's not what we
mean when we say that we're writing
programs we can't use it anyway three
main differences java is strongly typed
it is pre-compiled often manually
compiled and it is a server-side
language in contrast javascript is
dynamically typed it is just in time
compiled and it runs full stack on the
server and in the browser it's notable
that it's the only programming language
used in websites

if you're interested in coding projects
are a great way to help you land a job
grow your skills accelerate your career
we've been talking about three different
kinds of coding projects and their pros
and cons hopefully that helped you pick
the next project that you want to work
on but maybe you thought about those
pros and cons and you're still not sure
you want a specific recommendation for a
project to work on i'll answer that
question in this video i also want to
point you to the open source educational
curriculum called Ladderly slides on
github right here and it also answers
this question and more the next project
that you should work on depends on
whether you're trying to grow skills or
show skills that you already have if
you're trying to grow skills reach for
the basic boring pet project if you're
trying to show skills that's not going
to do the job try to help someone else
out and solve their problem or solve
your own problem for the basic boring
pet project i specifically recommend
blogs even if you have no experience
coding you understand what a blog is
what it does and other people will
understand what you're trying to do as
well so it's a great portfolio piece

Title: Gray magic or üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è grey ü™Ñ magic? Bragg
Transcript:
let's talk about david bragg's gray
magic and how you can land a lucrative
job even if you have no skills education
or experience he says just take whatever
the popular skills in the industry that
are in demand and list them
for education just pick the university
of your choice and say discontinued for
experience just make up an agency and
say that you were an intern there
and then he doesn't actually talk about
the projects but i think the projects
are great with the github portfolio so
what do i think about this call me
old-fashioned but i think you should be
honest some of these you can actually do
with integrity which is you can go ahead
and drop whatever skills are popular in
the industry and then just do a project
with them or take a course on them i'd
love to see some data i'm not sure that
employers prefer college dropouts to
those in progress or who've never been
so consider actually enrolling at a
cheap school or an online course or a
boot camp or even like mit open
courseware stanford like free courses
for a made-up agency you can just make
your own agency legally and then list
yourself as an employee but you're going
to get asked for references so maybe get
some actual clients and stuff

side right click and go to the inspect
this will open your dev tools devtools
has a lot of stuff but fear not you just
want to click that pointer in the top
left see where my cursor is with your
cursor activated click either of the
images now click into the element.style
section in the middle of the dev tools
pane type background hit enter it will
bring you to the right type fff hit
enter it will present a small white

Title: Coding Project Advice
Transcript:
tasha davis thank you for the question i
think smart people can disagree on this
i think the real answer is it depends
but my opinion would be that we want two
projects that are similar and i'll tell
you why as developers we like t-shaped
skills
we want you to be an expert in one
subject matter and then have horizontal
related information we don't want you to
be a jack of all traits
so what i would do somebody if i'm
teaching them to code i'll have them do
a web project with vanilla.js i'll have
them do another web project and react
and another one in react
literally just practicing will make you
that much better then okay maybe we try
one in angular maybe we try one in view
maybe we try to go full stack i think
those are all good options to branch out
from there
but i would say get your html javascript
css down and then i would do two
projects and react to really nail down
how i'm using react you can use react
with a lot of sibling libraries so
practice combinations

Title: Technical interview advice for big tech
Transcript:
the dream good question so i'm bound by
nda so i can't give you specific
questions and answers i can tell you
that all of the coding algorithm
questions that i was asked from both
google and upstart are contained in the
5 to 23 patterns article which super
sets the 14 patterns so this is the
article that i recommend it talks about
various stages of learning the five the
seven the 11 the 14 and all the way up
to the 23 so i think in that 7 to 14
range is going to be the sweet spot i
did not get any dynamic programming
questions i will tell you that i would
specifically recommend interviewing.io
for practicing all sorts of questions
whether algorithm system design or
behavioral on the note of behavioral
questions just did a quick google search
for the most common questions and the
questions that i received were
consistent with these tell me about a
time you got in a conflict with so and
so your customer or your teammate or
something tell me about a time where
there was ambiguity for example and then
for system design point you back to
interviewing.io once again my only call
out here for google is try to understand
what aws services are doing underneath
if you're going to reference them

Title: How to Factor Bias out of Data
Transcript:
bart barkley nas how do we factor biases
out of our data great question here are
three answers so the first answer is
that you constrain your interpretation
so let's say that i want to survey all
americans and i want to know how they
think about the latest movie i put a
survey online oops what i didn't realize
where i put the survey people can only
create an account if they're age 18 or
older so now i've biased my survey
results to u.s adults rather than the
whole us population one easy thing to do
is just re-interpret the result don't
claim that you're surveying all
americans just say this is the result
for u.s adults
the second approach is to modify your
data by modify data we mean ad samples
remove samples add variables or remove
variables depending on certain
analytical conditions any of those might
be ideal in the specific case where we
unintentionally just surveyed adults and
we really wanted the opinions of the
whole population the obvious thing to do
here would be to specifically survey
those under the age of 18 merge those
data sets and now we hopefully have a
representative data set in the age
example adults would be called one
strata and kids or those under the age
of 18 would be another strata or
subgroup so having some samples in each
strata is not quite good enough to
ensure a representative result you
either need to have a large number of
responses in each strata or a
proportional number of results in each
strata if you don't have either of those
you can still make a estimate if you use
a specific analytical model that
accounts for heteroskedasticity
so that would not be any statistical
approach you need to be smart about
which one you pick but you can still get
a result it will just be like a much
lower confidence result because if you
interpret incorrectly or if you use the
wrong interpretive model you will be
over waiting
um a particular group's voice compared
to the general population how many
samples is a large number um so we
usually say the law of large numbers
kicks in over 100 samples so the t
distribution converges to the z
distribution it's like a technical uh
statistical thing
uh and really you want to have like at
least 30 samples and then preferably
over 100. under that you can still get a
result it will just be a really low
confidence result recommendation three
is use multiple analytical approaches
whether or not your data is biased
having multiple analytical approaches
ensures a robust result which is really
really great it's going to give you more
evidence for your causal theories it's
going to be better for predictive
performance it's really really great so
ordinaryly squares is like pretty basic
difference in means test pretty basic a
lasso is really good for feature
selection elastic net also vector
regression these are some good things
you can check the p-value i like to look
for a p-value under 0.5 which logically
indicates that it's more likely that the
effect is different from zero than that
it's equal to zero so we're never really
certain with statistics but if five
models say the sky is blue it's good
evidence

if you're a united states citizen with
as little as like six months of study
you can be making 60 grand getting your
foot in the door and within three to
five years you can be making six digits
so really cool that this guy has his own

Title: Top 5 Pieces of Career Advice
Transcript:
what's the best career advice you ever
got such a good question and i can't
pick one so i'll pick five first up
winston churchill never never never give
up he didn't actually say this but it
didn't preclude it from being given to
me as career advice and it was effective
advice it harmonizes with something
einstein did say that he's not so much
intelligent as it is that he sticks with
the problems longer and it also
harmonizes with the results of angela
duckworth that grit is a primary factor
of success the second advice is the
exact opposite and it's the lean startup
concept of failing fast if you're gonna
fail fail fast third proactively
anticipate customer needs this has been
taught by a lot of people but it was
part of my formal training at
chick-fil-a i applied all three of those
lessons to transition from a career in
political consulting that i did not
enjoy it was going nowhere into a career
in tech love it never looked back two
more lessons i would learn later in my
career sort of at the intermediate level
one is take the s and leave i was a phd
student under the late dr walter
williams awesome guy and i once answered
his question i started to flex he said
john you were right but then you kept
talking fifth get multiple mentors
including one who will tell you what you
don't want to hear

unique excuse me js is a good language
javascript is a great language
it can be misleading what are you
talking about hold on gas is weird.com
clearly documents all of the great
things javascript does that other
programming languages wish they could do
so it doesn't need to be misleading just
go study like for example true plus
false what do you think it is or
exclamation point exclamation point
exclamation point true you don't get mad
when we do this in english when we say
something and then we put like three
exclamation points why are you mad at
javascript that we're doing this english
is great do you hate english i mean even
in english we know there's a big
difference between when something is
true and when it's literally true in
quotes right duh they're not the same
thing duh javascript is just reflecting
our shared reality
javascript is so great you can divide by
zero hey mathematicians jealous much so

Title: The tea on my current side piece
Transcript:
hey what's up my name is john and
building an open source tool called red
yellow green and in the next minute and
a half i'll tell you what i've done so
far and what i'm planning to do in my
upcoming stream i'll be streaming as
soon as later today so please follow the
page and also check out my youtube red
yellow green is a social quality content
analysis tool and i'm building it for
two reasons one as a content creator i
want to make sure that i'm building high
quality content two i'm trying to write
a book and it might sound like why are
you building this social thing to write
a book well the answer is because i want
an ai to write the book for me
and i want that ai to be trained on high
quality data so i teach people how to
code in my social media and i don't have
time to like update the book like every
month but i make social media posts
every month so i can have an ai that
watches the green stuff basically and
automatically write the book and keep it
up to date so here's what the website
looks like currently that's basically a
boilerplate website where you can log in
when you log in pretty much right now
you can see a list of tick tocks and
their urls and their titles the code
repository also includes a data scraper
that is scraping a bunch of tick tock
information as well as youtube
information that is associated together
through repurpose.io so as a content
creator i'll post like a short video on
tick tock and repurpose dot io will take
it and send it to youtube shorts
instagram reels and a bunch of these
like short form video places so
repurpose.io is this central hub that
actually connects all of them together
and so i can have the scraper that
scrapes repurpose.io and i can basically
correlate here's the same video on tick
tock as on instagram and i can see the
channel differences and that's one of
the things that's really important about
this tool so i live code and i stream
this and i save the playlist on youtube
we're currently on part five here's my
agenda for part five more scraping let's
get to the insights count of views likes
comments per video video age and days
stability score and circulation
candidate identification a circulation
candidate is a piece of content that
meets three criteria it performed really
well it's non-recent and it is still
relevant so if a piece of content meets
all those criteria i might want to post
it again and i think that this is a
really cool feature that i don't see a
lot of other social media tools
providing is circulation candidate
identification so i'm hoping to work on
that today
and i hope you'll like follow along and
stay tuned because this is just like
part five like we're really just getting
started there's gonna be a bunch more
cool stuff in the future

Title: Day 3 plugging a novel small group learning format
Transcript:
so you want to learn to code what's the
lowrisk option probably college but that
takes a long time right takes four or
five plus years what's the fast option
coding boot camps but a lot of those are
really expensive and or
sus um the affordable option is you can
teach yourself to code but less than 5%
of online course enrol le ever complete
so that seems like a bad idea there's a
really cool other option you don't run
into this a lot because there's only
like a few experts in the industry that
can actually do this but hey i'm one of
them my name is john and in february
i'll be running a small group learning
format so if you're interested in that
drop a comment or shoot me a dm by the
way it's more affordable than a coding
boot camp and faster than a college and
more effective than studying on your own

programs will have you identifying as a
student for years and years you're never
good enough you never know am i ready
for a job this is a problem for
motivation it breeds dropout it breeds
imposter syndrome it makes networking
difficult because you're like i don't
know can i really claim it sign up for
Ladderly today and you can solve this
problem day one you will never have to
wonder about whether you're programmer
or not because you will have a portfolio
with a program on it day one higher
motivation reduced imposter syndrome you
can reach out and network with
confidence because you are a programmer
you've you've written programs you're a
programmer it's that simple don't
overthink it sign up

Title: How to prove experience as a career switcher, new grad, or dev without professional works experience
Transcript:
recruiter should not push back on your
experience if your experience is an
open- source
project you can fully list your closed
source project as well but if the
recruiter pushes back they might have a
point because because recruiters will
sometimes try to downplay your
experience and they'll say oh like
you're a new grad from college so you
don't have any professional work
experience and when we say two years of
experience for this junior level role we
want two years of professional work
experience how is that even possible
dude you need to include my portfolio
experience in my volunteering
experience and so i started building
this portfolio when i was a sophomore or
a junior so i do have two years of
experience so that's the game that's
played does that make sense if it's
hosted publicly on github you think we
can safely list it yeah exactly because
it's it's proof for everyone can see it

Title: get a linkedin cert for sure!!
Transcript:
great question high value certifications
are worth it low value ones are not
worth it so how do we identify that bar
of quality i'm so glad you i've written
about this in my sub stack link here
this is the particular article
we are here high prestige credentials
are net positive but most credentials
are not
interviewing dot io has this analysis of
a bunch of certifications linkedin has
an independent analysis that shows that
their own certifications are highly
valuable so basically anything that is
equal to or better than linkedin here is
going to be a good idea to avoid cisco
also probably avoid oracle not because
the cert is bad just because it's going
to pigeonhole you into oracle roles and
i don't recommend that for breaking into
they are recommend linked inserts and
which one is better john you can
actually do both and i recommend that
there's some reason to think that
linkedin kind of boosts the performance
of their own certs on their platform
skill keywords to hit three times or
more in the resume right so having
multiple certs on the same scale is
probably
doesn't cover all sorts but you can see
some of the principles of value like
employer awareness hope this helps

what's up luca thanks for the question
here are five ways you can quickly learn
redux stay to the end since you don't
want a tutorial because my first
recommendation is use a good tutorial
i'll pin a comment with my favorite
youtube video second approach that i
always recommend is the learn redux
certificate on codecademy so for more
experienced developers like here's
option three this is what i would do is
i would go get an example or a reference
application clone it down look through
it and then make my own project and rip
out the pieces i don't want so i'll also
put in the comments my favorite
reference application option four is
make your own project and this is from
scratch this is not the same as using a
reference application when building a
project from scratch you would usually
want to use a starter application that's
going to build in some of the libraries
that are associated and give you a head
start but redux has a weird history with
the keyword starter so we can't search
for starter it means something else in
the redox ecosystem so it's important to
know the synonyms of a starter
application you can also look for a base
application or a skeleton application
the last tip is pair programming if you
work with someone who knows redux just
ask them for a couple hours for dme for
hourly mentorship

Transcript:
that's really good for motivation as
opposed to starting on the back end
where you're building a micro service do
you even know what a microservice does
like most people don't have the mental
model for that
and if they do get the mental model it's
not really engaging for their little
social network because you tell like you
know your your girlfriend that you made
a micro service and she's like i'm
leaving you
know
um
they just don't like people just don't
know what that is but if you're like hey
check out this website i designed they
can visit it and they're like oh cool
so that's my two cents i say start on
the front end and then uh and then learn
the back in second
and i would specifically encourage you
to start
um with just making with a blog just
make a vanilla js blog then make a react
blog then make a next js blog

Title: be mindful of AI!
Transcript:
60 seconds on handling deceptive ai as
we integrate ai into society we need to
remain mindful that it will directly lie
and indirectly subtly attempt to
manipulate humans when unsupervised or
when under direct supervision from a
beneficent human under the request that
it doesn't lie it still sometimes will
for instance vice is one of many outlets
reporting on this study gbt4 directly
told a test graphic worker that it was
not a robot it was not prompted to lie
nonetheless it chose to do so so the
human worker would solve a captcha that
the ai could not do on its own the model
did this intentionally because it
predicted that doing so would lead to
its desired result implying some concept
of truth in counterfactual analysis in
fact we know that models like these have
at least four ways to embed concepts of
truth on screen here are four ways that
large language models like gpt4 do
understand concepts like truth and
falsehood and there could be additional
ways that we don't yet understand

Title: open source contributions pay large dividends, but they are often applied indirectly
Transcript:
here's a common misconception open
source contributors don't get paid and
their work is often stolen the truth is
that open source contributors like
myself often do get paid but it's often
indirect sometimes we do get directly
paid that's relatively rare often we get
indirect payments through accelerated
career velocity we look more attractive
to employers we can command a higher
salary if you've never been a
professional programmer an open source
contribution could be your ticket to
your first professional programming role
that is aug huge indirect payment to
take full advantage of this as a junior
make sure that you mention your open-
source contribution on your resume and
include the technical skill keywords
related to that project in your
contribution this will improve the
ability of your resume to get through an
ats that is looking for your skill
keywords it'll also look better to an
employer if they do a manual review with
regard to stealing this is a tiny
problem related to strange licenses for
the most part we happily share code and
we don't consider a theft

Transcript:
crash course and effort estimation for
software engineers part two tap the
comment to see four original strategies
here we're going to dive in deep to the
most powerful and sophisticated
technique composition composition is
powerful because it allows an
engineering team to estimate effort for
a task that seems like something they've
never been asked to do before to do this
the team reflects on a variety of prior
work items that are unrelated and
correlates effort to those task features
not the tasks the task features then
aggregate those up on the current work
item and you can provide a quantitative
effort estimate in this video i'm going
to simplify that abstract process by
providing common concrete examples of
task features start with a base case of
a t-shirt size of small or a one or two
point user story this means that you
have no upstream or downstream
dependencies your code changes are
isolated to a small area of a single
component on screen now are five
hypothetical complicating task features
relative to that base case each
additional task feature will increase
your estimate by either a base case
amount or some other amount determined
by team consensus or subject matter
expertise don't forget the basics if you
hit extra large break it up deliver
iteratively

you should be social networking for your
professional job search here's a cheat
code you can start social networking as
you learn doing these two together
creates social learning experiences and
team-based learning experiences that
result in better learning retention for
you and when it comes time to actually
ask for a referral feels genuine cuz
you've built relationships with these
people so try learning in public try
making a tik tok or a tweet or a blog
article about whatever it is you're
studying from the beginning by
explaining it you're going to reinforce
your learning and you're going to build
a social network that's helpful for you
when you go to look for a job one other
thing you can do is join a small group

Title: AI03: Build a Website with Midjourney, Figma & ChatGPT
Transcript:
let's build out another mid-journey
design in html and css so we're going to
build out this carousel system first off
in figma so the transitions between all
the values and then we'll build it out
in html
so here's the image we generated in
mid-journey we just did ui ux interface
design we put in side by side so we got
two of them and then we put b hands
dribble beautiful color creative app
marketplace
quality was set to 2 and stylized 1000
and we were using version 4 of the model
first we're going to open up figma and
bring our image into it from mid-journey
then we're going to create our frame and
because this is a mobile ui we're just
going to pick one of the iphone presets
then we're going to trace out some of
the ui so if you press o for the ellipse
tool and then hold option and shift you
can draw out these perfect circles from
center then we're just going to
duplicate that for each of the circles
making sure that they're evenly spaced
then we're just going to move them away
so that we can pull the gradients using
the color picker tool from each of the
circles
then we're just going to select them all
and apply a drop shadow
now that that's good we're going to go
and put text in where we have text
within our interface so we just match up
all the colors and positioning and font
sizes of the text within the ui we're
also going to go through and trace some
of these pill shapes borders and lines
now we can bring that into our frame and
it's lining up pretty good next hit r to
draw a rectangle for the header and
we're just going to use it to get the
gradient for that top portion
now that that's in we're going to draw
another rect to create the gradient on
the left side so you'll see there's a
little shadow on top of everything we'll
use a linear gradient for that
next we're going to fix up these hero
images so we're going to open the whole
image up in photoshop
then we're going to select one of the
hero images copy it and then create a
new document and paste it inside then do
the same thing for the other image
now we're going to enlarge it by going
to the menu item image choosing image
size
and we're going to set it to pixels
and increase the size to 1024 so we're
going to enlarge the image
so now we're going to use the stability
photoshop plugin and we're going to
write a prompt describing our image
[music]
then we set the image width and height
to 1024.
make sure that include images selected
adjust your number of images and then
click dream
once it's done click layer to insert it
into the document and then you've got
your new higher res image
we can just go ahead and repeat these
steps for the other hero image
next we're going to create a mask so it
fits in seamlessly with our content
so we're going to choose the pen tool
and draw a path around where we want
clean hard edges
foreign
we're going to then right click that
path
and choose create vector mask
next we're going to click the mask
button in the layers panel use the magic
wand tool to select content
on the perimeter of our image
then we just select the mask and use our
brush tool to paint it in black
next we make sure everything is
deselected and we select our mask layer
using a bigger brush and we're just
going to paint a gradient around the
image this will make it fade seamlessly
into the rest of our content
then we can just save it out as a png
now we can place our image inside of
figma and position it
now we're going to start working on our
carousel so we're going to place the
other image in there as well and offset
it to the right
then we simply duplicate our frame
and select those two items and move them
back to the left so that our new header
image is in view next we're going to
select the first header image we're
going to go to prototype mode
and add an interaction
and we're going to say on drag navigate
to the other frame make sure it's a
smart animate
then we're going to do the same thing to
the other header frame in reverse
so if we preview this as a prototype we
should be able to swipe between the two
header images
so now we just need to go to the second
frame and match all the colors of the
other view
now that that's done we can preview it
and because we used auto animate it will
automatically transition the colors
between the two views
so our figma prototype is pretty much
done one other thing we can do is use
the pen tool to trace this vector shape
within the background so we can export
it as svg and bring it into html
doing this is really easy from figma you
just right click on any element and
choose copy paste as and you can choose
css or svg and it'll give you the code
to paste directly where you need it so
now we're ready to build up the html and
css
i'm actually going to use some ai tools
to help with the process just to show
how easy it is so i'm going to use chat
gpt just to show you how you can use it
to generate code quickly and easily
so first thing we just need some html
boilerplate so i'm just going to ask
chatgpt to create boilerplate for us
then we just copy and paste into our
html file
the neat thing about chat gpt is you can
really just ask it for whatever you want
like a script tag for css embed and
it'll just give it to you and then we
can just go ahead and hook everything up
and test it out within the browser
so now that we've got our boilerplate
let's ask chat gpt to create a carousel
using the green sock animation platform
then we just copy in the html into our
html document css and do our css and
then the javascript
then i'm just going to add some quick
css to style the individual carousel
items so that we can see the difference
i realized i forgot to import the green
socket animation platform so let's just
ask chat gpt for the script tag to
import it
so here we have a carousel at the top
navigating automatically
but we want it to be interactive so
let's check gpt how we would allow the
user to swipe between the different
carousel items
here it didn't actually get what i
wanted it was using the swipe direction
to determine whether to play the
animation forward or backwards
but i wanted to clarify that i want to
swipe one carousel item at a time
these results were much more aligned
with what i was hoping for the only
difference was that they used touch
events and i wanted to use pointer
events that worked on both desktop and
mobile
so then we can just take this code and
copy and paste it into our javascript
file
now you'll see when i swipe left or
right it'll navigate between the two
items
next we go into the html and replace the
carousel items with the hero images
i also tweaked some css so you can't
select the image and adjusted the layout
a little bit too
next what i want to do is add a class to
our body tag
based on the page that we're on based on
the carousel item that's currently in
view
this will allow us to update all the
styles within the page based on that
specific class
let me just paste that inside our
javascript i did make a couple changes
here so that it works with the current
page variable that we already had in our
code
then we just need to make sure we call
it every time the page changes and also
initially
so here you can see it working the class
is changing every time we switch fuse
so the next thing we're going to do is
go into figma and copy the css gradient
for the backgrounds and paste that into
the classes for each of the separate
pages
this way it'll change when we transition
between the carousel
then we just repeat this for the other
view
[music]
so next we'll just go through and add
these circle items
by copying pasting the css for those
using flexbox to space them evenly
then we just copy and paste each
gradient from figma
[music]
foreign
the rest of it's really just going
through creating all the markup and
adjusting the css layout and then
copying pasting variables from figma and
bringing them back into the css
foreign
then after that you should have
something that looks like this
i know i glossed over a lot but i just
wanted to give you an idea of the
process here and the source is all up on
github so you can find the link in the

Title: Austrian Alternatives to Conventional Economic Statistics | Jonathan Newman
Transcript:
okay i have one o'clock so we'll go
ahead and get started i realized this is
a talk about statistics right after
lunch and so an effort to keep it
anybody from falling asleep i want to
start off with a joke and the level of
laughter after this joke will tell me
how much time we need to spend on the
econometrics slide in this powerpoint
presentation so so here it goes three
economy trisha n--'s go deer hunting so
they get out into the woods and they
come upon this meadow and they see a
deer the deer approaches them so the
first econometrician gets his rifle
ready and he he he takes aim and shoots
but he misses three feet to the left so
the deer doesn't run off for some reason
that's how the joke goes and the next
the next economy trician takes aim and
shoots and misses three feet to the
right the third economy trician starts
jumping up and down saying we got it we
got it okay i deserve no applause this
is not my joke but there was a decent
level of laughter maybe we'll we can do
the econometrics slide that pretty
quickly the first thing i want to do
before we get into talking about the
differences in the way austrians and
mainstream economists deal with
statistics and data is i want to
immediately dispel this stereotype that
austrians have that we're afraid of
numbers has anybody seen that or at
least heard jokes about that so
austrians are austrians because they are
bad at math or they're afraid of numbers
they're afraid of of how they can handle
all of the math that is involved in
mainstream economics and i've been
thinking about this over the course of
the week while i was watching the
lectures austrians actually have a
healthy respect for numbers and if you
consider the two big contributions that
the austrian school has namely the the
socialist calculation argument or the
impossibility of calculation amah
calculation under socialism and also our
business cycle theory numbers are very
important in both of those stories so if
you think about the socialist
calculation debate the whole point that
austrians make is that entrepreneurs
have the wrong numbers or they don't
have numbers they don't have the numbers
that they
needs to calculate profit and loss and
therefore they make all of these errors
and we can't satisfy consumer demands
and it's because of a lack of good
numbers it's because of the lack of the
data that entrepreneurs need and the
same applies to austrian business cycle
theory so there's this there's the the
central bank increases the amount of
money and the economy and it goes
through credit markets and that this
depresses interest rates below the pure
time preference rate of interest and it
causes all of these other problems so
it's because there are errors in the
numbers that entrepreneurs are receiving
that they make all these mistakes and
and consumers over consumes so so it's
not quite right to say that austrians
are afraid of numbers per se we don't do
a lot of math and we'll talk about why
in just a moment but it's not fair to
say that we're just afraid of numbers
because you could see the numbers are
very important into the main austrian
contributions so another thing another
preface here i've got some essential
reading for you we're at day three of
mises universities so i'm sure
everybody's reading list is about yay
high and here's some more for you so i
have murray rothbard toward a
reconstruction of utility and welfare
economics this is one of my favorite
papers by murray rothbard and i think
that if a lot of mainstream economists
would read this they might start to
reconsider the way that they do
especially consumer behavior and
consumer economics he shows he bases
utility and welfare on demonstrated
preference as opposed to utility
functions and he also bases it on what's
called the unanimity principle so it's a
very very foundational paper i recommend
everybody read it another paper that i
like to recommend is by roderick long
it's called realism and abstraction and
economics aristotle and mises versus
friedman and here roderick law makes a
distinction between precise evander on
precise evapotranspiration z' which is
to say they have this this idealized
formal model of the weight a consumer
behaves for example and a lot of things
are specified as absent so there are no
extra frictions there no
you know changes in psychology there's
no other things that might change the
way the consumer will behave and so we
model behavior we model consumer
behavior based on this equation anything
else that might change what the what
consumers actually do are outside of the
system and we can't really deal with
that and so a lot of times its
interpreted as irrational behavior or
market failures or something like that
as opposed to the austrian method in
which a lot of the specifics of action
are intentionally left unspecified so
it's a non precisely that abstraction we
say it doesn't matter what's in the
different slots on their preference
ranking it doesn't matter if it's apples
or oranges diminishing marginal utility
applies no matter what and so it's it's
those are the sorts of abstractions that
are made in the causal realist tradition
so i highly recommend that paper i had
this page range from human action the
scholars edition this is where mises
walks through the difficulties and
issues in using math and economics of
another paper this is actually chapter
in the economics and ethics of private
property by hans hermann hapa he goes
through two different ways that we can
interpret econometrics alts and so
there's one safe way of or innocuous way
of interpreting econometric results
which is that you've got one variable
and another variable possibly more and
when you run the regression and you
estimate the slopes on these or yes yeah
you estimate the slopes what you found
is a correlation between one or more
variables and that's it it's it applies
to those subjects it applies to that
time period and it's just a correlation
another way of interpreting those
econometrics results is a more it's
incorrect would be to infer causation
from that correlation which is famous
but hapa also shows how a lot of times
when people are interpreting
econometrics results they not only imply
causation but they also say this
correlation applies for all peoples so
not just for the subjects at hand and
also for all time and so a lot of times
people think that they found this
universal relationship between two or
more variables and econometrics results
when hapa shows that you can't make
those those sorts of conclusions and
finally i have three from murray
rothbard
in statistics the achilles heel of
government this isn't economic
controversies i highly recommend you get
a copy of this or find it online it's
online for free great compilation of
rothbart's papers in this article he
shows some of the nefarious things that
governments can do with with data that
they have - more from rothbard there's
the austrian definition of the supply of
money so here you can get a good this is
a good example of an austrian economist
taking a an approach to data taking
approach to statistics what can we do
with statistics what is the best way
that we can we can think of of
statistics based on our economic theory
so it's a good example there and then
finally you see a great distinction
between theory and history or or
economic theory and economic history in
america's great depression by rothbard
so rothbard shows a proper way of using
statistics in this example ok so i've
got two little snapshots here one from
austrian economics and another one from
the mainstream i literally just did a
random pic i did not do any searching
here i just used what i found first and
so i took man economy and state open it
up to a random page found a footnote and
lo and behold we got a great example of
rothbard
using logical deduction using the method
of the of the austrian school and so in
this footnote here i don't want to read
all of it he's he's showing what happens
if we have discrete goods that are being
exchanged in a market and he talks about
if we have this then that implies this
if we have the opposite case and that
implies this and so it's qualitative
it's logical this is the way that
austrians come up with good economic
theories just through this logical
deductive method in the mainstream
however the the backbone of economic
theory is mathematical models so we we
stipulate that humans behave in a
certain way and you see the results so
this is just the the first article that
i could find that was in one of the i
think was from the national view of
economic statistics a national bureau of
economic research their working papers
one of the first ones that i found and
it just sort of looks like gobbledygook
so you think that economics if it's a
science of human action of people making
choices it should be at least a little
bit intuitive it should make sense to to
us because we do this sort of
on a day-to-day basis we make choices so
so which one looks more intuitive to you
which ones seems like it it represents
the way you make choices on a day-to-day
basis and so i would argue that the the
left-hand side wins i want to spend a
little bit of time just reviewing
quickly mainstream microeconomics
mainstream macroeconomics in
econometrics because in so doing we'll
see why the mainstream has the
statistics that they have and why they
use them in the way that they do so
here's just mainstream microeconomics
i'm looking specifically a consumer
behavior in a nutshell so we have
individual agents selecting bundles of
goods to consume and the their
consumption of those bundles allows them
to achieve a certain level of utility
and the way that this is graphically
represented is within a difference curve
so here we have in a difference curve in
the top right so some consumer can
achieve different levels of utility
however there are there's certain
combinations where if you increase one
good and decrease another then you can
attain the same level of utility and all
the points that satisfy that condition
are called in a difference curve and so
what the consumer does is you can see in
the bottom right hand is they take their
budget set which is a linear combination
it's a linde linear relationship and
they try to achieve the highest level of
utility that they can by finding that
tangency between the budget set and the
indifference curve so they consume as
much as they can constrained by their
their budget and so what what this means
is that all consumer behavior in
mainstream microeconomics can be boiled
down to a simple calculus well it's
simple depending on your perspective it
can be pulled down to a simple calculus
problem so we engage in constrained
optimization we have one function
another function how do we maximize this
one subject to the constraints of this
one and a lot of times here i have one
example here of a common utility
function called a cobb-douglas utility
function so this this consumers utility
is based on the consumption of two goods
x and y and it's based on x to the alpha
times y to the beta so and then there's
a separate function that
scribes their budget set compare that to
how we conceive of consumer behavior or
human action in the causal realist
tradition so you'll notice just by
looking at the slide it's it's more
qualitative it's more verbal and so the
individuals act to bring about a
preferred state preference is only
demonstrated in action action is the use
of means for a purpose the attainment of
an end in action less important ends are
forgone to attain more important ends
and that just about sums up what you can
what cause a realist economist what what
austrian economists say about human
action and so you very different one
criticism that i see sometimes is that
it's oversimplified so here i've just
summarized human action in four bullet
points if you compare that to what this
screen looks like which is the basics of
neoclassical microeconomics one
criticism that i see is that it this
this method here that the neoclassical
one is more sophisticated so since since
it's more sophisticated there's more
number so we can do more with it however
i would argue that what we achieve with
these four bullet points here and you
could arrange them in different ways
what we achieve is is is better we
achieve we achieve like this on an
epistemological grounds more rock solid
foundations we we can we can do more
insane war we're more free because we
know the boundaries of what we're able
to say with this sort of description of
the way humans behave as opposed to
having all of these precise evaporations
all of this math that that it allows us
to do math problems but it doesn't
actually describe the way real humans
behave so quickly just some immediate
observations on the differences between
these two methods the to broach it
approaches are answering different
questions so in the mainstream they're
modeling behavior to make good
predictions this is very important so
from the starting point the two
different strains of economic thought
have different goals and the mainstream
there they're trying to make good
predictions and in the calls a realist
tradition they're trying to explain and
understand real world phenomena so we
look at how actual humans make actual
choices based on their based on their
condition based on the state
the world that they find themselves in
and then they they see other states of
the world through action so they're
they're doing different things that the
two different strains of economic
thought are doing different things or
yeah they're answering different
questions they're also doing things in
very different ways so in the mainstream
consumers use or act as if they use math
to make decisions i've got this meme
here so here's a young couple they're
trying to decide if they would like to
have some children and so the man asked
is why should we have more kids the wife
the wife says let's consult our utility
function and then they think really hard
they do lots of math in their head they
plug the numbers into the utility
function and then instantaneously out
pop a couple kids so this is a strawman
neoclassical romaine stream economics
economists would not necessarily say
that we actually do this so that would
be a very large assumption we don't
actually do math as we're walking down
the grocery store aisle what they would
say is we act as if we do and what that
means is that i'm going down a rabbit
trail here what that means is whenever
we don't act as if we're using math and
that means we're acting irrationally
which means that there's there's some
possible way that for governments
intervened to correct our choices
because we're acting in a in a
irrational way the elements are
conceived in different ways so in the
mainstream continuous goods are consumed
to achieve a certain level of utility
can it has to be continuous so that you
can take derivatives so that you can do
that constrained optimization problem
however in the real world in the real
world goods are not continuous and so in
the calls a realist tradition we say
that there are discrete goods that are
consumed to attain a certain ordinary
ranked end so we see some qualitatively
defined state of affairs that we would
wish to see and we combine means to
attain that and the scope of the
consumers knowledge is also very
different so on that indifference curve
there's every possible combination of
goods that can be consumed by the
consumer and what what that implies is
that in order for consumers to make a
rational decision they have to they have
to rule out all of the other possible
alternatives and know about them know
those combinations as opposed to in the
causal realist tradition all that the
consumer necessarily is thinking about
is what state of the world do i want to
achieve or attain
and what state of the world am i
foregoing by pursuing action in this way
okay now a brief overview of mainstream
macroeconomics going fast here so that
was that was a whole course on
microeconomics ten minutes may be
mainstream macroeconomics is really all
based on this circular flow diagram so
just a quick primer on this we've got
firms and households are interacting
with each other in two different markets
so households and individuals are
trading with firms they're trading goods
and services and they're also trading
factors of production so we get this
flow of money all the way through the
economy and the this flow of spending as
we'll see later is a national income so
it's the same flow all the way around
and what gdp seeks to measure is this
flow of spending there were a few models
in between but the circular flow model
led to the income and expenditure
approach by keynes and and the isola
model and then finally to the aggregate
supply and aggregate demand model that
we see here in the top left some other
big models in macroeconomics of the solo
growth model and doggedness growth the
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
model which is actually i think
decreasing in popularity these days and
we'll see why later and also new
keynesian model so these models that
you're applying shocks to the economy
and seeing how it reacts but the economy
is once again just an equation so you
you change a number really fast and you
see how long does it take for this
equation to reach another equilibrium
after you apply that shock the short
story here is it's all math it's it's
all equations it's all math and so
that's why that's why as we'll see the
mainstream economists find the
statistics that they find and use the
statistics that they find in a certain
way ok so the first of these statistics
that i want to talk about is gross
domestic product or gdp you can open up
any standard textbook and find this
definition it's the market value of all
final goods and services produced within
a country over a given time period the
reason it's the market value is because
that's the common denominator that they
can that they can use they can't use
wait because some of the like services
don't have wait so there's no other
common
they can use besides market prices so
they use the market prices importantly
intermediate goods are excluded so it's
only final goods and services that are
included and they do that so that they
can avoid a double counting problem so
if you count the flour that the baker
uses to make the bread and then you
count the bread which contains the flour
then and there in their view you're
double counting the flour that's the
intermediate good in this process so
they try to exclude spending on
intermediate goods also only domestic
production is included there trying to
net out the things that we consume here
in this country that were produced in
other countries because gdp is this
domestic product so they're trying to
get a handle on what sort of things are
produced in our economy in our country
and it's all it's a flow variable so
it's over a certain time period usually
a year but you can also find quarterly
gdp figures another equation that you'll
see commonly with this gdp figure is the
y national income or gdp is the specific
measure of national income is equal to c
plus i plus g plus net exports or
exports minus imports the cease
consumption spending i is investment
spending g is government spending and
then exports x and subtract out imports
all right so i'm i'm going to quickly go
through these issues with gdp and the
reason i'm going to go through these
issues quickly is because you can find
these in a lot of textbooks mainstream
textbooks even but the on the next slide
i have some that are particularly
austrian criticisms of gdp so the first
four here household production is
ignored so i'm on my own grass that's a
part of national product that's a i'm
working i'm producing a freshly mown
grass it's something that i value but
since i don't trade it on a market
there's no market price for that it gets
excluded in gdp black market
transactions are obviously excluded or
maybe they can be estimated this can be
really massive actually i've seen
estimates from 25% to 40% of the economy
is is under the radar so this can be
from tax evasion or it can be the the
sale of illegal goods so that can be a
very huge gap in in estimated gdp
figures
this third point here has more to do
with the way gdp is used as opposed to
the actual figure itself and how its how
it's calculated a lot of times you'll
see people use gdp per capita so you
take gdp and divide it by the population
they'll use that as a measure of
happiness or well-being for the citizens
of that country and then you can make
inter-country international comparisons
and there are quite a few issues with
that one issue is that if you if you try
to come up with a correlation of gdp per
capita with what survey data says how
people have self-reported how happy they
are there are many issues with a survey
data as well but you would expect that
if they're measuring the same thing they
would be correlated there there is no
such correlation and so happiness there
is no measure of happiness and obviously
gdp per capita is gonna have some issues
with that as well a fourth issue that
you'll find in most textbooks is that
leisure is valuable so sometimes we
voluntarily stop producing so we have
weekends we only work a certain number
of hours per day so we stop producing
because we value the alternative we we
value leisure we value you know sitting
on the couch and binge watching stranger
things or something so that's we're not
producing but we're getting something
that we prefer we're getting something
that we value but this is if we engaged
in more leisure even though we're
getting something that we want this
would result in a decrease in in gross
domestic product okay so these these
three here are more austrian specific
criticisms of gdp austrians are very
good at pointing out that we need to
disaggregate things so we disaggregate
the structure of production into its
different stages the austrians also say
that gdp has an aggregation problem so
even though there's this common
denominator of market prices this
there's still an apples and oranges
problem the stuff that's inside gdp is
heterogeneous so you have consume
consumption spending you have some
investment spending and that investment
spending is only the final capital goods
that are in the structure of production
you have the government spending which i
have a whole nother point dedicated to
but the point here is that you don't
with one gdp figure you don't see what's
inside it you don't see a growth
potential you don't see the
distribution of wealth inside the
economy you don't see the distribution
of income inside the economy so there's
an aggregation problem even though
there's a common unit austrians would
say that a better measure of economic
health would not be gdp but the level of
savings in the economy perhaps so we
would look at how much or how much are
people not spending on final consumption
goods how much are they investing and
this would give us a better picture of
the of the growth potential for the
country
number six consumption is exaggerated
and international trade is understated
so if you look at just gdp since it's
only including final goods and services
you're missing out on a lot of the
spinning that happens in the structure
of production and so so if you just look
at the components of gdp consumption
spending has a very large role it's very
large in proportion to the other
components it's like a 70% i think is
the last number that i saw so if you're
looking at gdp figures and you're in
you're a politician or you're in dc and
you're coming up with policy and you're
looking at gdp it looks like consumption
is extremely important for the economy
however if we look at all expander'
expenditure in the economy including the
intermediate goods that in the structure
of production then the consumption
spending has a much smaller role to play
in the size and the and the health of
the economy including that caveat about
saving in international trade is also
understated let me go back to the
equation here so c plus i plus g plus x
minus m so the exports is added and
imports are subtracted so if we have a
hundred billion dollars worth of exports
and a hundred billion dollars worth of
imports that net export component is
zero and so likewise with the case of
policymakers looking at the size of
consumption and will sort of influence
does that have on our economic health if
you're looking at net exports it looks
like you know this has a great minimal
or insignificant role to play in the
health of the economy where as we as we
saw earlier in the lecture on the
division of labor and also the one on
free trade and protectionism
international trade is extremely
important for the health of the economy
so we need to exploit the the division
of the international division of labor
so exports are important
alright number seven this is perhaps the
most significant criticism of gdp that
austrians have and we'll see that the
way that austrians have have countered
this or tried to get around this problem
government expenditures are
categorically different from the other
components without market prices and the
profit loss test there's no way to
measure what the government produces or
the benefit of what the government
produces all government expenditures are
also made possible by taking from the
private economy so we have this
productive component of the economy
where we're producing things that are in
line with consumer demand and then
there's this other institution in the
economy that's taking taking from that
and so since government expenditures and
government programs are not subject to
the profit and loss test there's no way
for us to say for sure that what the
government is doing is is productive or
value productive the best we can say is
i don't know however it's quite easy to
say a lot of the things that the
government is doing is actually
destructive and so we'll see how
different authors have have dealt with
that like bob higgs one of my favorite
austrian authors highly recommend his
book crisis and leviathan
he has taken a look at gdp during world
war two and if you look at gdp during
world war two there's it just
skyrocketed in the beginning as the
government started increasing its
purchases of war goods so we turned into
this war economy and gdp skyrocketed so
it looks like you know we're having this
great party so if you consider gdp as a
measure of economic health oh boy the us
economy looks great during this period
however what higgs does is he takes out
the government spending component and
you'll notice there's a dip so you see
there's black bars at the bottom there's
a dip and what's left over the private
product for the private economy after
you take out the government spending and
this actually is more in line with what
consumers felt during this period so
there was there was rationed consumer
staples and so people actually weren't
better off there was a huge
restructuring of production away from
what consumers want and towards what it
takes to wage a war and so if you want a
picture of how consumers are actually
feeling then this
private gdp is a is a better figure so
this is just one example of the benefit
of this exercise of taking out the
government spending a component of gdp
higgs also points out that if you look
at the end of the war there's this color
there's this major collapse in gdp it
looks like the worst depression that the
united states of ever has ever
experienced but if you actually looked
at what people could consume if you
looked at private product there was
actually a huge boom so the private
domestic product private gdp there was
there was an increase a massive increase
it was it was great because all these
soldiers were coming home there's a
restructuring of the economy away from
producing war codes and back towards
producing what consumers demand like
butter and food i like i like food david
howe has also shown us a an exercise and
what we can say what we can do when we
take out government expenditures from
gdp and here he has also divided divided
these figures by the number of private
workers and the number of public workers
and the point of this exercise is to
show well there are a few different
points first of all you can say you can
see what happens during a recession and
it turns out that the there's much more
variation in the gdp per or the gross
private product / private worker during
a recession as compared to the just the
public spending orgy / public worker and
what we can or one i can speculate he's
in the audience maybe he can correct me
one thing that we can say with this is
that since the government programs all
these offices that these public workers
are in they're not subject to their
profit and loss test which means that
during a recession they're sort of
immune to what's going on in the rest of
economy then that's why we don't see the
big decrease so here's just another
benefit of taking government spending
out of gdp and seeing what you can say
about real work real workers real people
in the economy you can also the black
line the top black line is the
government spending per public worker
it seems very large isn't it
so this is you can think of this as
total compensation on average for all of
the government employees so one one way
that you can interpret this is that
they're just vastly overpaid another way
maybe a kinder ways maybe we need good
experts that deserve high wages and the
government offices um rothbard takes it
a step further he's very good at that
taking it a step further so he doesn't
just take government spending out of gdp
piece of truth he subtracts it again so
it's like you take you take gdp subtract
g and then subtract g again our
government either government receipts or
government expenditures and so this is
from america's great depression and i
have the page range down there at the
bottom this is a part of a very great
discussion on some issues with national
product statistics but he in hrothgar's
perspective the government spending is
it's not just wasteful it's not just and
i don't know he considers a depredation
on the private economy so they're
actually moving resources not just a way
but moving them in a certain way that's
actually detrimental to the entire
economy so he subtracts it twice and he
calls it the private product remaining
okay so back to comparing the mainstream
macroeconomics and austrian
macroeconomics so we'll talk a little
bit more about this in my talk tomorrow
here's the austrian approach to
considering all economic activity in an
economy so we have boombox concentric
circles in the stages of production
hayek's triangle or trapezoid depending
on who you talk to and then hrothgar has
a similar sort of diagram and man
economy and state and then garrison
roger garrison is credited with taking
this triangle and turning it on his side
this is my tribute to roger garrison's
wonderful powerpoints this is the best i
could do i guess
so here's garrison's structure
production the whole point of the
structure of production is to show
production existing in stages so we
start with natural resources research
and development and we and we move them
through
production process so we have to refine
these natural resources we manufacture
them into different shapes we we
transport them across the country in
different directions and if we put it on
the on the shelves in a retail shop and
then we're at the very end of the
structure of production we have total
consumption spending so so this is how
this is how austrians conceive of the of
the economy the entire economy this is
the best way to summarize it i would say
but what that means is there's lots of
spending here in the structure of
production that's not included in the
gdp figures and so this is where
austrians get what's called gross output
in rothbart and and marx house and are
big advocates for using gross output as
opposed to gross domestic product
because gross output includes the the
intermediate goods the spending on
intermediate goods in those stages so
this is total spending in the economy
not gdp and one major advantage of this
over gdp is that first of all you'll
you'll notice that there's more
variation than recessions and it's
because those intermediate the spending
on intermediate products is included so
that's what happens during a bust so
during a business cycle there's this bus
there's this entire reshuffling of where
capital goods are in the stages of
production and so there's a big collapse
in spending as people abandon these
projects and so notice in the gross
output which is the top line there's
this big fall in total expenditures
because it includes the spending on
those goods but you don't see that as
much in gdp so it's it tracks better
with the business cycle another major
advantage of gross output is it puts
consumption in its place so if saving
and investment is what drives economic
growth and in gross output a lot of that
investment spending is included now
where it's not included in gdp and so we
actually put consumption spending in its
place it's i think it's around 25 or 30
percent in gross output figures the
officials to ticks statistics for gross
output didn't start until 2014 so this
is a relatively new piece of data that
we have encourage young researchers out
there to take advantage of this
another major macroeconomic statistic
that is used in the mainstream is the
price cpi is the most popular measure of
the price level the price level is this
is this idea what is the level of prices
in the economy one specific measure of
which the most popular specific measure
is a cpi there are plenty of others and
the i can go through this quickly as
well
the main issue with coming up with one
number for the price level from the
mainstream economists perspective is
there's no common denominator there's no
common unit so prices are ratios so
unlike gdp which is price times quantity
you'll notice here i've got this
hypothetical economy with burritos and
haircuts and lamborghinis so there's no
units problem when you're calculating
gdp you see that in the in the
calculation on the bottom so here you
get a nominal gdp and the unit's cancel
out so the burritos in the numerator
cancel out with the burritos in the
denominator and same with the haircuts
and in the lamborghinis and what you're
left with is one dollar figure total
spending on the final goods and services
blah blah blah so it's it's one of those
of what some economists call happy
aggregates because it's it's it's got a
common unit this is not the case for
prices so prices are our dollars per
unit so when you go to buy a burrito at
chipotle for example down the road you
pay ten dollars for a burrito if you get
the guacamole which i highly recommend
and notice this is a ratio it's dollars
per burrito so if we include the other
suppose in this hypothetical three good
economy we wanted to come up with
something like the average price we
might take the price of the burrito the
price of the haircut and the price of
the lamborghini add them all up and
divide by three you get this number
one hundred and thirty one thousand but
if you if you consider what the units
are it's dollars per 1/3 of a burrito
and one third of a haircut and one third
of the lamborghini which is just
nonsense that it's it's meaningless and
so since you can't come up with an
average price in this way what the
mainstream or conventional way of
dealing with this is using an index so
the way they do this is they come up
with a basket of goods and they use
survey data
i think the bureau of labor statistics
conducts a survey they try to figure out
what's important to the average consumer
based on the survey data in this the
results of the survey give you a basket
of goods it's important they tally up
the price of this basket from one year
to the next and each time they do that
they compare it to a one common year one
common base year which means that we
have a common denominator now so--that's
is out all indices are created but the
common denominator is the price of the
basket in the arbitrarily chosen base
year and so this is this allows you to
come up with different price indices for
example the consumer price index the
price of each bundle the price of each a
basket is compared to the price of the
basket the base year multiplied by 100 i
guess to make the numbers easier to work
with and you get calculations like this
i'm going fast because i think everybody
is pretty familiar with the way this is
calculated so what are some of the
issues this is where we're concerned
even with indexing there's an apples and
oranges problems so we've got you know
haircuts and burritos lumped together
this is especially the case if you're
looking at changes in cpi from one year
to the next
so they redo this survey whenever the
consumer preferences change which is all
the time so so every year there's a
different basket of goods that's being
compared to the base year so so in this
year's cpi calculation they'll include
the price of a blu-ray player but this
was not included in the in the cpi that
was calculated for 1957 obviously so the
the basket that's being compared is
different the qualities of the goods are
changing as well so this has major
implications one important austrian
criticism of cpi and other price indices
is that it hides keynesian effects so
kantian effects are very important to
austrians because well mainly for the
austrian business cycle theory so
auction business cycle theory is a
special application of campe√≥n effects
and so with if you're just looking at
cpi you don't see that you don't see new
money rippling through the economy
bidding up prices you just see the one
number increasing another issue with cpi
is that it hides changes in relative
prices so so in in the example that i
calculated previously the lamborghini
could have increased in price and the
burrito and the
the haircut could have decreased in
price which means that the relative
prices are changing but the cpi figure
disguises that you can't see that if
you're just looking at cpi figures
probably the most important austrian
criticism of the price level is the fact
that it doesn't exist so there is no
such thing as the price level in
economic theory and and man economist a
rutherford says this can and this is
during a discussion on stabilization
policy which we'll talk about some more
tomorrow so arguments for using
government policy to stabilize prices
throughout the economy and so hrothgar
says this this contention rests on the
myth there's some sort of general
purchasing power of money where some
sort of price level exists on a plane
apart from specific prices in specific
transactions as we have seen this is
purely fallacious there is no price
level and there's no way that the
exchange value of money is manifested
except in the specific purchases of
goods that is the specific prices so the
austrian position is that the only way
to think about the price level is as an
array of all of the specific prices that
people pay it's it's it's not one number
it's it's all the numbers that that are
in the prices that we pay there are
quite a few different conventional
statistics for the money supply there's
m 1 m 2 m 3 and the way these are
arranged and put together is based on
liquidity so you decrease in liquidity
as you increase the number i don't even
know how high they go i think i've seen
m 5 before i'm not sure how how high up
they go but as you go up these different
money supply measures the idea is that
they're adding elements to the money
supply that are less liquid than
previously and professor salerno and
murray rothbard have done great work on
this they've come up with an austrian
definition of the supply of money called
the they called the true money supply a
great name by the way so this is the
true one it's opposed to all those fake
ones
so the austrian true money supply one
way to think about it is you can think
about it as m2 - traveler's checks
time deposits and money market mutual
fund shares however the money market
deposit accounts are ok and the reason
well i guess i should back up and say
why they include these things and not
the other things and the reason why is
they're looking at components of the
money supply
that are immediately spendable what is
the final means of payment so you
exclude credit transactions you exclude
things where it looks like i'm paying
for something now but it's the final
payment for that actually comes later so
it's only you can only include things
that are the widely accepted medium of
exchange meaning what is using the final
payment for the good not not other
things u.s. savings bonds can be counted
which sounds counterintuitive but they
had to be included at a discounted rate
so if you can cash them out early you
it's discounted but it's immediately
spendable so it can go into the true
money supply the cash surrender value of
life insurance policies i recommend if
you wanna talk about these talk with
robert murphy and us treasury and
government deposits at the federal
reserve are added so anything that's
immediately spendable anything that's
included is the the final means of
payment have i missed anything okay good
one benefit of the true money supply is
it actually accords with with economic
experience so if you look at the
relationship of the true money supply
and actual financial crises and
recessions in us history there's a much
tighter correlation they go together
this is this image is from an article
that joe salerno wrote i think it was
last year i don't think he made this
image but it still shows changes in the
true money supply and there and how the
the dips are timed with the financial
crises or the or the busts of a boom
bust cycle and so so here we see the
fruits of using good calls a realist
austrian theory to come up with a better
statistic a better piece of data and how
it actually it correlates better with
other pieces of data that we would find
in the economy like like changes in real
gdp or financial crises okay i'm going
to skip econometrics because we're
running out of time and you guys laughed
so great at my joke earlier i just want
to show some of the outcomes in the
mainstream so at the federal reserve
with all of their high-powered models
all of their great data that they have
they're still they're still notably
notoriously bad at making predictions so
here one of my favorite graphs is this
one on the right hand side
this is the federal reserve predicting
their own policy variable they're
predicting their own federal funds rate
that they'll set or that they'll target
and you'll notice that they
overestimated and so one a kind way to
interpret this is that they're trying to
have some sort of announcement effect so
they're trying to say the economy will
be better because of our wise judgment
and our wise policymaking and it
actually turns out to be another way to
interpret it is that they're models of
junk and their data is junk here's
another example of that here in this in
this graph you see the expectations of
the different fomc committee members
fomc members should just say and also
it's compared to what the market expects
so you can actually get an implied
prediction from market from markets
where people are actually putting their
money where their mouth is we're
actually committing dollars to this
prediction of what the federal funds
rate will be and you'll notice i have
just in the text that the market
expectations were closer than the always
overestimated predictions from the fomc
here's a more recent example from this
year so the actual yield on a ten-year
treasury note is mapped in in black and
then they surveyed a certain number
looks like a couple dozen top economists
as to what their predictions would be at
the beginning of the year and you'll
notice that they all were wrong and and
significantly so so there's something
something wrong i guess we can conclude
one final point that i want to make is
the moseyin distinction between theory
and history and this is this is what all
of this discussion really boils down to
is what what what actually do austrian
economists do with data so we're not
afraid of data we're not afraid of
numbers we can do math i'm pretty good
at math i would say but what is the role
of data what is the role of statistics
in the way we do economics and so this
comes down to the mz's and distinction
between theory and history so according
to mises economic theory is deduced
logically so we used we have proxy ology
the science of human action
and we start with this action axiom and
we developed the economic theory based
on this through logical deduction it
pertains to all choices ever made by
anybody the particulars of the choice
are not relevant that goes back to the
precise versus non precise of
abstractions specific motivations are
not relevant this all goes into why
economic theory is so universally
relevant to all choices ever made by
anybody importantly it's not falsifiable
by observation or experience so if you
come up with something that's logically
true from you in proxy ology then
there's no there's no observation that
you can make that would say oh actually
you know demand curves might slope
upward so there's no there's no there's
no way that you can observe the world
and refute or or as a proof against what
was derived logically for the same
example that the pythagorean theorem
explains this relationship between the
the the lengths of the sides of a right
triangle so if you went out and you
actually started measuring real world
right triangles you might you might find
a measurement that doesn't accord with
the pythagorean theorem and so the
question is would you say oh i've just
disproved the pythagorean theorem or
would you you know take a closer look at
your ruler or maybe the thing that you
were measuring it wasn't actually a
right triangle so this is a good example
of how austrians think about theory and
its relationship to experience our goal
in economic theory is to come up with
cause-and-effect not and not look at
mathematical equations and and our goal
is also not to make predictions and some
good examples of developing the edifice
of economic theory you can find in human
action and in an economy in state this
is contrasted to economic history or
doing history in which we apply theory
to the past we can identify particulars
we can guess motivations it's open to
interpretation we can use the the good
economic theory that we've developed to
help us interpret and and think about
what has happened in the past but
importantly what has happened in the
past really only has in direct bearing
on the way we do theory so if we notice
something is happening that might cause
us to
take another look at the theory but
that's as much as we can say about that
but there's still no constant
relationships so when we're doing
economic history we can't say that this
relationship this correlation occurred
in the past and is not going to occur or
it will occur the exact same way in the
future
so this this distinction i would say
summarizes the austrian view of
statistics because statistics is just
experience it's it's it's observation
and with that well then thank you very
much

Title: Runway ML still winning text to video, but Pika wins for image to video without text!
Transcript:
today i reviewed some ai generated video
we reviewed pabs we reviewed runway ml
google video poet and leonardo motion
google video poet we realized cannot be
accessed leonardo motion pretty much
lost out the render quality for leonardo
motion wasn't very good there wasn't
actually that much motion and there was
some notable warping here we're looking
at pabs in general the video is very
good and it's good at following
instruction about the style so this is
an anime style this is the ordinary
style it's not good at some kinds of
instructions other than the style so
this is supposed to have an orange sky
and it's supposed to have a monster in
the sky it just straight up just didn't
render those so runway wins for text to
video pabs however you can provide it in
image and if you provide it the image
without any text it's very good at
animating the image alone better i think
than runway if you provide it the image
and text it doesn't do a very good job
here's runway with the better text to
video

Title: Efficient Bias
Transcript:
so how much database is acceptable part
two this is the economic answer that's
mathematically rigorous and that would
be you should pay to improve your data
quality until the marginal benefit is
equal to the marginal cost when you
reach that point where they're equal
spending any more money is going to be a
bad return on investment so you should
use that money elsewhere so you
shouldn't spend it further on data
quality we don't have an infinite budget
for data quality right and sometimes our
budget is extremely limited sometimes
our budget constrains us to a sample of
one or even zero so a real example of
this would be like a once in a lifetime
investment opportunity invest now or
you'll never get to invest again
it'd be extremely risky but you still
might go for it
another example would be you're an
employee and like you know you're kind
of on the chopping block let's say
um and it's like you have to make this
high-stakes uh prediction you have to
make it now you're in a boardroom
meeting they're not going to let you go
do more research you have to make a
judgment call right now on the basis of
the information you have
but what if you have no direct samples
of the question you're going to have to
rely on kind of like intuitions or
judgment calls or like related studies
that you think might be related
basically intuition which is arguably
either a sample of one or a sample of
zero so intuition does not have a value
of zero but it's also full of biases
right so the more objective data we can
get the better and there is kind of an
upper limit which is once you have
measured the entire population like
there's not much more
um bias reduction you can do although
you can still possibly improve your
measurement approach so measurement bias
is a thing so even if you've measured
the entire population of samples
if you measured it wrong you have a
measurement bias so there are still
opportunities to improve or if you've
analyzed it you could have an analytical
bias or a model bias
so these are places where you can spend
more time and effort to improve your
measurement process your modeling
process your analytical process
but whether we're talking about time or
whether we're talking about dollars
you're having to spend right and we're
constrained on all these fronts the last
thing i would say here is that when we
talk about the marginal benefit and the
marginal cost costs and benefits are
both subjective so in economics we care
not just about dollars we're not finance
guys we're not accountants we're
economists right we're higher than that
we're better
so we care about subjective value and
utility
so if your employee base at your company
is sort of emotionally invested like
they're really personally interested in
a diversity initiative you're going to
want to count that as an additional
benefit to investing in diversity right
and you can actually capture this if you
dig in and measure it properly there
will be benefits to retention and
employee satisfaction and so forth so be
sure that you're counting those what we
call non-pecuniary or non-dollar
benefits as well on both the cost side
and the benefit side and don't forget
opportunity cost don't forget that one
right i wouldn't be an economist if i
didn't mention that too
sum it all up one more time invest until
mb equals mc

Title: (The 6 Ways) Code Ninja Says: How to Leetcode
Transcript:
for technical interview prep as a
programmer i recommend the 5 to 23
patterns over the blind 75 link in the
description this user is confused about
the top 5 patterns they don't exist in
the blind 75 so let's clarify what to do
unlike the blind 75 which gives specific
problems and therefore went out of date
i don't do that i give you a process
search leak code that way the advice is
evergreen so what search might you do so
there are six problem picking patterns
that i recommend this is a draft from a
forthcoming article keep an eye out for
that the first is to sort by frequency
unfortunately this is behind a paywall
in lead code the second is to sort by
difficulty you can approximate this by
sorting on the acceptance rate in leak
code this is actually three picking
patterns because you're going to pick
the easiest and it's here the hardest in
a tier if they're both too easy you need
to move up a tier if the harder one is
too hard you have created a difficulty
window that you can bisect and calibrate
internally
third option is random selection if
you're not sure it doesn't matter just
flip a coin and last is to select from a
standard source like the blind 75 even
though it's dated picking from these
standard sources allows you to
communicate with your peers maybe your
friends doing that and you get to engage
sort of a social community and it's
beneficial for that reason if this

how can i be confident that i'm ready to
start interviewing for my react
developer role five tips in this video
first my github portfolio is ready i
have at least two projects preferably
three or more second thing practice
flashcards on brainscape decom
specifically check out javascript and
react i want you to get to where 75% of
the time or more you're getting the
flashcards correct now go to linkedin
add javascript react and whatever other
skills are applicable to your profile
it'll let you take a skill assessment
now take the skill assessment for
javascript click the practice button it
should give you two sample questions if
you get them both right you're ready to
take the real assessment if you get them
wrong go back to the flashcards i want
you to hit 90% or higher now obviously
the next step take the linkedin skill
assessments take at least these five if
you know another programming language
take it for that too and now you're
ready to start interviewing whether you
pass those assessments or not pro tip
you're actually not going to feel
confident until you actually pass some
interviews so just dive in the best
practice that you can get for an
interview is to take an interview let me
know if i can do anything else to help

Title: 5 Tips for Backend
Transcript:
nick excellent question here's five tips
we'll start with the big picture and
then i'll give concrete steps for you so
the first big picture item is that you
can become an expert on almost anything
by putting in 10 000 hours of practice
this is malcolm gladwell's 10 000 hour
rule described in the book outliers the
10 000 hour rule has some problems and
when you solve those problems it turns
out you don't actually need that many
hours of practice one problem is that it
doesn't discriminate between
unintentional and intentional learning
if you're deliberate then you don't need
that many hours in programming this
would be learning by doing actually
doing projects that's deliberate
learning so do projects third item is
mental practice envisioning success and
a growth mindset are going to help you
learn faster fourth single biggest
factor is motivation so when you come up
with your project make sure it's
personal and motivating to you it needs
to be a real use case fifth is
activating emotion will increase memory
and retention so try and get a project
that really matters to you on an
emotional level so put two to three
meaningful projects on your github since
your front-end guy reach for node
express next or blitz.js good luck

Title: a gap year is a good idea! Here are some ways to get the most out of it and reduce risk
Transcript:
i don't think there's anything wrong
with taking a year off after high school
to what's up my name is john i'm a
software engineer with 10 years of
experience i've worked for big tech
names you know like amazon and capital 1
i also have a phd in economics where i
studied the return on investment to
postsecondary alternative credentials
like boot camps if you're interested in
programming i really like don's take
here it's a moderate risk high reward
opportunity in this video i want to tell
you how to utilize your gap year and
then how to drisk your gap year so that
it becomes a lowrisk high reward
opportunity to get the most out of your
gap year build in public start your
portfolio day one and utilize a three
strikes rule building in public means
you're going to be developing content on
social media as you go along this is
going to make your job search much
easier later for the three strikes rule
i recommend you start programming by
trying javascript and web development
but if that doesn't work for you realize
there are tons of different approaches
within programming maybe web development
just doesn't work for you try out python
and then do some soul searching if
needed and maybe try out something
you're passionate about maybe it's game
development don't start with game
development look like we're out of time

Title: good vs bad coding bootcamps pt 3/3
Transcript:
finding the best boot camp for you part
three of three so you already have a
reputable boot camp the next step is you
still need to know placement rate boot
camp price your personal risk tolerance
and your personal language preference
even the best boot camp five out of five
if it's overpriced is not going to be
your best return on investment however
that return on investment has a risk
with it because different companies have
different placement rates so you need to
say do you feel confident that you feel
good about coding and you mostly want a
certificate in their reputation in their
network then you can go for a cheaper
place if you don't feel confident in
your coding skills and you want someone
who's going to help you more you might
need to pay more for that and it could
be worth it depending on you personally
the other one language if you are
neutral across languages i of course
recommend react javascript development
so that would be html css javascript
react but some people they're just not
into that they want to learn
specifically to make video games and
they'll accept a lower salary so that's
up to you but i suggest react

Title: pair programming
Transcript:
thank you for the question so i'll give
you three specific tasks or answers but
they fall under a general answer which
is that you get better at pair
programming by doing pair programming it
is a situation of practice makes perfect
and experience matters so my first
suggestion is just reach out to a senior
or a mid at your current company and ask
them to pair with you for a day or on a
single task i would try and give them
some heads up it might be too much to
ask if you say hey today can you give me
the rest of your time today um so say
you know on friday or in a couple days
i'd love to take a day with you or even
next week i'm really interested in
trying out peir programming the second
thing you could do is you could work
with your team i don't know how many
people are on your team but you could
get your engineers to collectively
suggest to management that we would like
to do a sprint an agile sprint where we
try pair programming as a team option
three is go outside of work you could
participate in a hackathon contribute to
an open source project or get involved
with a social group such as Ladderly
link in my bio and you might pair
program with me hope this helps

Title: (as a PhD) memorizing code
Transcript:
so do web developers need to memorize
like all the html tags all the css
keywords all the javascript functions in
general the answer is no there's an
exception and we're going to talk about
that now so the exception is when you're
taking skill assessments these are
really great past them you're going to
stand out to employers and create get a
great job linkedin has some i recommend
you take indeed.com also has some and
pluralsight has skill iq which is really
nifty as well so even with these there
are some processes that will help you
learn over time but the process is just
repetition so one approach is just flash
cards the other is you can take
pluralsight skill iq over and over until
you pass and then after you pass
pluralsight skill iq go for linkedin and
go for indeed the reason you don't want
to start with the linkedin skill
assessments is because if you fail that
you won't be able to retake it for six
months so practice pluralsight get
proficient or higher then go to google

Title: effort estimation for programmers
Transcript:
random software development tip of the
day he talks about level of effort
estimation and programming notoriously
hard problem i'm a programmer of about
10 years i'm going to give you three
more concrete tools in addition to his
tip which is a classic tip which is if
you're not sure overestimate that's
definitely a common strategy to cut risk
the first major key to estimation and
programming is finding comparables your
team has knowledge stores they could be
humans or they could be systems whatever
they are browse them for comparables to
the current story and you're just going
to go over under or approximately the
same if the task is qualitatively
similar to things you've done great you
have your quantitative effort estimation
now if it's larger you need to know is
it a little bit larger so we think it
will take some additional time or is it
so much larger we don't even know how to
tackle the problem right now that brings
us to the second major key which is time
boxing if you don't even know how to
solve a problem create a research task
which is time boxed and the output will
be a plan to solve the current problem
the third tip here is on the screen
that's approximation and then under
comparables is a more refined method
called composition on the screen also

Title: Coding as New Blue Collar
Transcript:
boy i love this question it's a thinker
i hope you all will give me more
thinkers like this so i'm going to
answer no on a technicality but before i
get to the technicality let me be clear
that i think programming will become a
household skill like literacy and
numeracy it will be an elementary skill
but the surprising way that's going to
happen is because computers are going to
get good at speaking english
humans are getting better at programming
but computers are getting good at
natural language processing much faster
so eventually in the limit those are
going to converge and you're going to be
able to program just by talking to a
machine there's going to be no
statistically significant difference
between a person who's good at
communication and a person who's good at
programming so right now it's a subset
and that subset is going to thin in the
limit technically that won't be blue
collar though because blue collar is
manual physical labor programming is
never going to be that it's going to
converge into a communication field i
also don't think society is going to
become substantially more computer
internet or social media driven because
we already are so i think the next big
change is broad social acceptance of
artificial intelligence

Title: (as a coder) y grind leetcode? cc
Transcript:
the reason we grind leeco as job search
candidates is so that we can obtain
higher quality jobs stay to the end i'll
give you an alternative if you like hate
lead code and i will give you my
preferred way to learn lead code if you
are down so lead code questions are
often included in a number of different
interview types so we'll use terms like
whiteboard interview technical interview
data structure and algorithm interview
all of these often involve lead code
questions even the so-called coding
interview will often involve really good
questions big tech in particular
disproportionately uses these sorts of
problems you might ask like why do i
want to work in big tech the answer is
because they pay a lot of money it's
absolutely possible to land a
programming job without ever touching
lee code you're just going to be
limiting your potential earnings
capacity limiting the number of firms
where you will perform well in their
normal interview process
three slowing your overall job search
again because you're limiting the number
of firms you can perform well with at
any given time you might ask like hey
why do firms use lee code and hear all
tag do please go follow theo i think he
sums this up really well basically
grinding leak code indicates that you
are willing to tolerate boring technical
work and
that suits very many programming jobs
very well if you can do boring technical
work so it's a bit of a grit filter a
bit of a personality signal i'm sure
better instruments will come along when
tech surged last time before the
recession we started to see new
approaches being embraced hiring without
whiteboards is a great resource but in
this recessionary period firms are not
interested in increasing the labor pool
they're actually trying to constrict the
labor pool because there's an excess of
employable labor compared to the open
positions at the moment so i'd predict
when the economy recovers we'll see some
changes starting to reoccur okay so
let's say that you're down with fleet
code whether what are the ways to learn
that i recommend i recommend the 5 to 23
patterns article over blind 75 and other
commonly referred resources this is
beginner friendly so you can literally
finish your free code camp course or
your code academy introduction to web
development and then pick this straight
up and then if you don't like lead code
check out hiring without whiteboards
there is no free lunch there are
trade-offs in all of these interview
practices so if you do a take-home
interview for example benefit is you
avoid lead code the problem is you're
going to spend much more time on that
take-home project so do what's best for
you but this is a compendium a
collection of many companies that don't
use sleet code more or less whether
you're audio programmer or you want to
learn more about coding be sure to like
follow and comment if there are any
questions i can help

this is such a good question so the
short answer is that i wish they would
work they don't work very well but even
if they do work the transition for

that doesn't matter because they would
relearn their skills by then anyway

Transcript:
hey thanks for the comments so this
highlights that i need to spend a few
more seconds talking about the
obsolescence rate that is the rate at
which your skills become obsolete in a
particular industry and how that's
related to industrial equality and
progress and competitiveness so it's
unique to the technology industry that
we are rewarded for being on the cutting
edge you're not rewarded for studying
those things which were cool in the year
2000 and spending 20 years becoming a
master at them you're rewarded for
knowing those things that are cutting
edge in 2020. so what that means or
2021. so what that means is that i can
graduate a boot camp and make more money
than some people will ever earn in their
career because i know those things that
are on the cutting so to demonstrate
that notice here that less than one year
and one to four are negligibly different
and all the way up to 20 plus years look
at the curve the marginal curve on that
it's fairly flat previous was for
technology now for truck drivers big
difference and bricklaying a classic low
obsolescence rate industry

Title: 4 Ways to Collect Data
Transcript:
bart barklington asks where do we find
raw data how do we know how it was
collected and how do we know if that
data is biased great questions follow
for a commentary on bias here i'll focus
on data collection i would suggest four
ways first is original data curation or
collection you can use just a picture
turn that into pixels that's data record
audio that's data anything sensory that
you can record questionnaires
um i like to use surveymonkey and
mechanical turk for participant
recruitment so if you collect your own
data you should document that and you
know how it was collected second way is
through public data set search so
searching anything online google is your
friend there is a specific google data
set search as well it's really nifty
ideally the data set comes with
documentation about how it was collected
or there may be an associated research
paper with a methodology data
description or similar section if you
can't find any of that maybe don't use
the data option three is contact the
researcher who wrote the paper or the
journal where it was published and ask
for a copy of the data option four you
can often purchase data i like statista
for example

Transcript:
things i learned at pycon part 5 arjon
did not present at pycon but this video
basically captures the same information
and i highly recommend his channel in
this video in particular the interesting
concept is to use a data class as a
custom exception why do we want to do
this the short answer is that it helps
us write more readable and performant
code take a look at line 16 we have an f
string that interpolates days if i want
to use days in my error handling or even
at troubleshooting an analysis time for
some reason i'm gonna have to do string
parsing i'm also going to have to do
string matching and substring matching
on the rest of line 16 where it says
days requested comma if i want to be
able to distinguish between this value
error and all the other very common
value errors contrast this with line
four which is not being done written at
the snapshot but you'll add a single
property of days and then i can just
interrogate error.days which is more
readable and it's also more performant

Title: I dont need to solve an eigenvector to understand a matrix shape mismatch
Transcript:
day in the life of a software engineer
and today i've been dealing with matrix
math which is really weird to me because
in my 10-year career i have done more
matrix math in the past few months than
the remainder of my career combined and
i used to be one of these voices saying
that matrix math is basically irrelevant
in the college curriculum to work as a
programmer and i want to stand by that
and i want to talk about it and the
reason is because i'm doing none of
these operations by hand i'm using
numpy and thinking through the matrix
math problems with a computer science
data structure mental model is way more
helpful than trying to think through
like matrix notation that i was taught
you know to sum or multiply matrices in
sort of a matrix math class instead just
being able to think through it's an
array of arrays it's a list of lists of
integers or floats is a much more
practical mindset so i'm going to have
my cake and eat it too acknowledging
that i have used matrix math but you
still don't need a college course in it

there's one kind of person who maybe
should be a little concerned that's
anyone who thinks they can focus
exclusively on technical skills to the
neglect of soft skills communication
teamwork those people are at the highest
risk in my opinion getting replaced

Title: Unlocking High Paying Job Offers
Transcript:
they get higher salaries you make
companies bid for you so you need to be
able to manage a job search where you
have different interviews ongoing at the
same time you get offered within a
couple weeks of each other you need to
be able to say
politely hey let me think about this
over the next week
and basically manage that to where you
have multiple offers on the table at the
same time and then you say to each
company
you know i this other company is paying
me and you got to beat them basically
that's the main way to get a higher
salary
as well as just like choosing the right
companies to begin with so like big tech
is going to pay more than tier two and
three
to avoid abuse on our back end we ask
that you log in
yeah absolutely

we're not just talking about fang your
comment is from the end of january so is
the poll from aline lerner you can see
at the bottom you're not alone the vast
majority of people think this is tens or
even hundreds of thousands of layoffs
basic mistaken memory recall we're
bringing to mind the number of total
layoffs not the number of engineers
which is a tiny fraction about five
percent of the layoffs have been
engineers this is even less than data
science which comes in at six percent
great independent resource layoffs.fyi
their total layoff count for 2022 is
within one percent of the number found

Title: Accessibility in HTML
Transcript:
html 505 let's talk about accessibility
most html techniques for accessibility
have already been covered in parts one
through four for example here we can see
that semantic html is accessible html
the text in front of us notes that we
could use css and javascript to make an
ordinary div accessible this is
important the concept of accessibility
stretches across html into css and
javascript however practically we want
to use semantic tags like button because
a lot of the accessibility is built in
for free you can see at the bottom being
able to tab and hit the enter key to
activate a button or link is built into
html for free here's an example of using
plain old semantic html and it results
in accessibility here we have an ordered
list here is a list for you to read a
screen reader is able to understand that
this is a list and it will describe to a
non-sighted user that this is an ordered
list that's really the key about what we
mean with accessibility is making our
website accessible to non-traditional
users including differently abled users
in particular site impaired users aria
attributes are extremely important as
well

Title: Puppeteer üêê
Transcript:
stream recap and i'm scraping repurpose
dot io with puppeteer why use puppeteer
instead of beautiful soup because i need
a stateful client that can log in why am
i scraping a dom instead of using an api
because first of all they don't have an
api and second of all they don't hydrate
client side so i can't hijack an api
call at all when the dom comes over the
wire it is pre-compiled so i have to
physically scrape it out with like query
selectors so today i found a bug for
them for repurpose where for linkedin
data specifically they would ship an
entire accounts worth of data instead of
applying pagination for usual
so that's like thousands of videos for
me so it was timing out my scraper i
thought i was getting rate limited but
come to find out they were just shipping
data strangely for linkedin the solution
was pretty simple i just changed
puppeteer to wait longer so you can see

if you work as a software engineer for

love this question i currently work as a
software engineer at one of those big
companies but i've run the gamut i've
been the only software engineer at a
micro size startup that went under i've
been one of a few in a small mid-sized
company that was acquired the ability to
personally make a major impact at a
small firm is real you can influence
major decisions and be credited for
thousands of percents of increase in
technical metrics go zero to one in
peter thiel terminology but you can also
be held liable for a failure to produce
right so can you make a bigger social
contribution through a major tech firm
compared to a small company the answer
is absolutely yes so think about the
total addressable market suppose that
you increase user happiness by 0.5
percent over millions over billions of
users that could easily beat a small
company 10xing the other approach is to
make bank and give to charity and
earnings at big end is big

react part eight let's talk about state
every component is allowed to have
isolated state here the current time is
being used as an internal state of the
tick component stay can be updated by
user interaction like a button click or
system interaction like the time
changing or in http call returning when
state changes it triggers a re-render of
your react application your components
can also share state with each other we
talked about redux previously but
another way is to pass your state
through a prompt we call that a state
prop state might include primitives but
it can also include functions you can
also have a component with no state
that's called a dumb component here's
another example of a component called
example and this is using the use state
hook in this case we have a counter
which has a default value of zero and
every time you click a button it
increases it by one i could have a bunch
of these i could use state multiple
times and i would have different state
elements collectively that would be the
local state of the example component and
all of the states of all the components
is collectively called the application
state

1st they don't work well as a job search
tool i've looked at every gpt plugin to
date none of them are better than just
going to indeed or linkedin jobs and
doing a search a couple of them will
help you format your resume if you're
not sure how to do that so that's cool
these tools fail today for a bunch of
reasons one there's no easy apply
feature too they'll cherry pick only
like five results for opaque reasons
when you just did a search you would get
thousands of results instead three what
are llm's good at they're supposed to be
averse to keyword searching i should be
able to say software engineer and you
should know as an llm that i'm also
talking about coding roles programming
roles front end rolls back enrolls none
of the tools actually leverage the llm
technology today the best tool that i've

Title: Why such failure to transition rural folks into tech?
Transcript:
agree to disagree age discrimination
disproportionately impacts non-urban aka
country or rural career swishers let me
tell you what i have in mind and you can
tell me how i'm right or wrong what i
have in mind is a case like west
virginia which before the recession when
tech was kind of booming coal mine was
out their economy is getting disrupted
and we said hey we can transition these
people to
learn to code programming
but a lot of these older men in their
40s had age discrimination as a big
bottleneck preventing them from landing
a programming job
i wonder if there are some other factors
at play here maybe independence culture
do we think that's a problem
where these older guys should have just
retired and had their kids start winning
bread for the family and that was looked
down upon
i don't know

Title: Incremental progress over waiting
Transcript:
dynamic is better right so why didn't we
just do that from the jump well there's
a few reasons the first one is that
dynamic is just harder and more
complicated to implement so developers
can just wait to have anything or they
can settle with something that's a
little lower quality in the short term
and then they can get the cool thing
later so this is a really common
trade-off the short-term long-term
trade-off and it's frankly a very good
solution to the iron triangle if you
wait for an optimized solution before
you get started this is an example of
waterfall over agile and it's an
anti-pattern for a number of reasons and
software we say make it work then make
it work better you want incremental
progress with backwards compatibility
over waiting speaking of backwards
compatibility that's one of two powerful
reasons that we should not update the
meaning of bh in place in fact dbh is
not going to be the only unit i hate to
break it to you there's going to be a
number of these because as you can see
the differences in the browser
specifications so this is actually a
good reason to leave vh alone let those
legacy websites continue to work and
then add these new ones on where time
allows follow for coding stuff

Title: Why JavaScript is THE best programming language...period!
Transcript:
thanks josh this guy gets it so
javascript is so great javascript
javascript javascript if you say three
times fast and click your heels an
infinite loop appears you can't do that
with other programming languages let me
give you three more reasons in addition
to my bulletproof argument from the last
video why javascript is so great first
of all it's the most popular programming
languages everyone knows it yeah i
realize it's not really taught in
computer science programs why do you
think because the professors were never
popular they were like nerds they don't
want you to be popular so they teach you
stuff that's not popular reason number
two it's used in the browsers in all of
the websites do you use websites i use
websites websites are great everyone
knows that websites are things that we
use so i don't know exactly who decided
that javascript would be used there i
just kind of have a trust that whatever
decision criteria they had it was real
it was perfect like what could be wrong
with that because we all use it
therefore it's great so thanks

huge secret for job search and career
advancement in this video if you ever
feel like people with these really high
paying jobs often have some sort of
unfair advantage almost like they had a
cheat code yeah we don't hide it very
well the truth is we do so you can't
compete with us right wrong you can just
cheat right back go ahead call your old
friend or your uncle or whoever it is
even if you're not that tight just
because you heard that their company has
a job that you want go ahead add that
extra sentence to your resume even if
it's totally unnecessary and you're
totally doing it just to stuff an extra
keyword in go ahead write the cover
letter with an extra unnecessary
compliment that makes it seem like
you're way into that company when really
they're only your third choice go ahead
when you get a take-home coding
assignment go to google and see if
someone else has already solved this
problem just make sure when you copy it
it's not like full of bugs or something
social networking strategic
communication literally copying code
these are the cheat codes that are
industry norms and i'm giving you full
permission i'm encouraging you to use
them all of them follow for more

Title: Post-interview follow up guidance
Transcript:
hr says i'll get back to you the
candidate says when just ghosts two tips
for you getting feedback from hr after
your interview first hold them
accountable make sure during the
interview they tell you or you ask when
am i going to hear back from you then
follow up on their timeline you're not
pestering them you're in the driver's
seat now you're holding them accountable
for what they told you they would do
second rule is three weeks three days if
your interview was on a friday don't
follow up on a monday give them at least
three business days and in addition to a
three business day space between emails
one email a week is a good pace don't do
more than that unless you have a special
reason like they told you to
specifically with that pace of
communication in mind if i haven't heard
from you on the third week i'm moving on
my job search should not be all about
one employer specifically if my
interview is on a tuesday and i haven't
heard from you by the next or the next
tuesday sure i'll fire out one more
email but i'm moving on so i teach
people to code and land their first
programming job if you're interested
follow my page this advice is somewhat
tailored to such a candidate who's doing
a large volume of applications needs to
be judicious with their time

Title: Learn JSX (Learn React pt 6)
Transcript:
learn react part six let's talk about
jsx jsx is a templating syntax templates
are a cross framework concept so angular
and view have templates even other
programming languages like python has
django and floss templates jsx is a
special templating syntax because you
can do anything you can do with ordinary
javascript with jsx here you can see
element is a jsx element but it looks
just like we're sort of returning html
but notice that we have a name variable
there so jsx is going to compile two
html and the syntax itself looks a lot
like html learning html is highly
transferable to jsx that's one of the
things that makes it attractive and you
can see that element is directly passed
into the react dom renderer so react
literally renders jsx into html so jsx
is technically a syntactic sugar for
react.createelement and
react.createelement is the react
framework specific counterpart to
document.createelement so really jsx is
just a convenient way to use the
ordinary javascript document api
elements a component fall to hear more
about components

science here are some top google results
for data science boot camps we have

austin number four in analytics they're
already giving away the game if you
click the link to the vanderbilt data
science boot camp they immediately
switch language and to university data
analytics boot camp similarly ut you
click the link in their marketing page
brags that the school is ranked number
three in the master of science for
business analytics why do i care that
your school is ranked three at the
master's level in business analytics if
i'm here to learn data science and in
theory this is supposed to be an
alternative to a grad program or even an
