Ladderly.io is pleased to announce two different AI tools for you to use!

This article describes each tool with its area of focus. Both tools are available as part of Ladderly Premium:

1. [Ladderly Chat](/chat)
2. [Ladderly Copilot](/copilot)

## Ladderly Chat

Ladderly.io Chat is a chat app similar to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) or [T3 Chat](https://t3.chat/chat).

Ladderly Chat is a blank or untrained mode of chat which directly sends your messages to the underlying foundation model. We do not use any of this data for training at Ladderly.io.

## Ladderly Copilot

Ladderly Copilot is a trained model which is aware of:

1. Ladderly.io site content
2. Thousands of Ladderly.io videos and social media posts
3. Curated additional content, tools, and answers to frequently asked questions

Use cases include:

1. Language-based search: Find relevant Ladderly content using natural language queries
2. Career guidance: Get personalized advice on your tech career path
3. Technical assistance: Get help with coding problems and project ideas
4. Interview preparation: Practice technical and behavioral interviews with feedback aligned to Ladderly.io's unique approach
5. Learning support: Access curated learning resources and study plans
6. Trained role play for soft skill development

## Sample Questions

Here are some common questions that Ladderly Copilot is trained to help with:

1. How should I learn to code?
2. How can I land more interviews?
3. What projects should I build?
4. How can I identify a high-quality coding bootcamp?
5. What are some social networking and communication tips?
6. How should I approach content creation as a software engineer?
7. What are key concepts in web development?
8. What distinguishes senior engineers from junior developers?
9. What are some job offer negotation tips?
10. How can I design and evaluate a technical project?

## Interview Simulation Tips

Practice different types of tech interviews:

1. Coding rounds (algorithms, practical problems, take-home projects)
2. Behavioral questions
3. System design discussions
4. Recruiter screenings
5. Technical conversations

Get feedback on your performance and learn how to improve your perceived impact with the [Pirate Store (STOARR) Method](/blog/2025-02-24-behavioral-interviews).

## Game-Based Soft Skill Development Usage

Improve your soft skills through LLM-assisted role play with:

1. Simulated workplace scenarios
2. Communication practice
3. Performance feedback and coaching

A sample prompt for this use case might be:
"Provide a simulated workplace RPG episode. Let's focus on team communication."

Additional prompts can be found in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvoNVvHFGCI).

## Technical Design Usage

Ladderly Copilot can help you construct a design document for a technical project, or ballpark impact related to a previously completed project.

Three pro tips for this use case include:

1. Be explicit about whether you are estimating a prior project or asking for assistance in authoring a new design document.
2. Consider drafting the design document and then further refining on a section-by-section basis. You might ask, for example, "Help me refine the Risks and Mitigations section of this design doc."
3. Use the [Paste from Markdown](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/12014036) feature when copying output into a [new Google document](https://docs.new/).
