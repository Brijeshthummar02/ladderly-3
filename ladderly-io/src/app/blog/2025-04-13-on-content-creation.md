Content creation contributes to social network growth and inbound opportunities which can [more than double your rate of interview](/blog/2024-08-04-no-cover-letters#an-original-contribution-of-data). In 2024, Ladderly.io released [this free video masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWTaRvF7sSU) on the topic. The current article summarizes that video and adds updated guidance, improving performance and preventing some common pitfalls in the process.

In addition, content creation is an excellent way to build your communication skills, learn by teaching, and drive adoption of side projects! Building projects with real users can improve your tech career by allowing you to better understand tech company tasks that you might otherwise not be exposed to, similar to working in a startup.

## The Main Idea: Stream Repurposing

1. Live stream once per week
2. Send the live stream to an AI clipper called Opus Clips
3. Post these clips directly from Opus Clips to TikTok
4. Leverage Repurpose.io to automatically repost from TikTok to many other platforms:
   1. YouTube
   2. Facebook
   3. Instagram
   4. LinkedIn
   5. X / Twitter

## What Should I Post?

Here are some kinds of content you can post on social media:

1. Educational material
2. Jokes and memes!
3. Diary-style posts about what you did today
4. Pain point disclosure and requests for education: Where can the community improve?
5. Mixing in non-tech content is fine too. Share your hobbies and build a human connection! Don't be afraid to join a trend!

## Update Guidance

Ladderly.io now [strongly recommends the use of BrandGhost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS1i1Q4SLkw) as a second layer of content creation in parallel with stream repurposing.

BrandGhost enables automated scheduled circulation of content across many channels. This creates a two main benefits:

1. Your content multiplies across more platforms in more modalities than otherwise supported in the Stream Repurposing strategy alone, with little extra effort.
2. You are able to post daily across channels at the cost of a one-time setup and optional occassional updates.

ChatGPT's image generator is also much better now, so memes and image editing can generally be done by prompt alone. [Here's an example](https://chatgpt.com/share/67ff37c4-e48c-800d-b6fb-9e39b2a48b51).

## Pitfalls

Common content creation pitfalls include:

1. Holding an excess bar of quality. This leads to lower post frequency and suboptimal ROI to time and effort. Text posts can be short and conversational. Cell phone video quality with little to no editing is standard.
2. Avoiding automation and AI. You use them on the job, so why not here?
3. Sticking to one platform and failing to engage with others. [See engagement tips here](https://www.ladderly.io/blog/2024-05-31-networking-tips#long-term-networking).
