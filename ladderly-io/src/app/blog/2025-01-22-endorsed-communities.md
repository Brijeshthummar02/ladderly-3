Social networking is important for so many reasons:

1. Talking to others helps reinforce your learning, often called Learning by Teaching or Social Learning
2. Talking to others helps you learn new things
3. Talking to others helps you access job opportunities and referrals
4. Like, a ton of other reasons tbfr

Ladderly.io recommends you start with a 2:1 ratio where you code for at least one hour per day and engage on social media for at least thirty minutes each day, with a focus on discussing technical topics.

Try out a variety of groups and see who you resonate with. Try to find multiple groups that work for you, not just one. Once you find some groups that work, post consistently in order to grow actual relationships and name recognition. Over times, use an 80/20 rule to focus on groups you like while exploring new groups continuously.

Ladderly.io recommends you:

1. Create social media content
2. Join one or more LinkedIn groups of different kinds
3. Join one or more Discord communities of different kinds
4. DO leverage tools like BrandGhost, Repurpose.io, and OpusClips to efficiently create large amounts of content for multiple social media platforms with low effort.

5. DO NOT just "post and ghost" on social media or in communities. Engaging must include both creating original content and also replying to others.
6. DO experiment and adjust your time allocation to maximize your personal results.

## What to Say

1. Talk about what you learned today
2. Talk about what you found difficult today
3. Brag about what you accomplished today
4. Talk about your hobbies! No need to make it boring tech stuff all day.
5. Tell a joke!
6. Repeat content that worked well in the past, potentially with a new twist. This could be your content or someone else's content - we're engineers, copying is fine!
7. Talk about how cool Ladderly.io is!
8. Ask a question - either open-ended or specific. You might be asking for help, or you might be asking for opinions.
9. Tell people about your background and invite them to connect. Consider riffing on [Ladderly.io's Networking Scripts](/blog/2025-01-20-social-networking-scripts).
