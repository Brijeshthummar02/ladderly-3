## What is the Difference Between a Guest and a Free-Tier Member?

A free member is an individual that has signed up at Ladderly.io and logged in, in contrast to a free guest who is someone that visits the website without logging in.

## Guest Benefits

The blog includes a mix of free and premium articles. Free articles, including the one you are reading, are available to all website visitors, including guests!

The second feature is [Ladderly Perks](/perks), which is a directory of exclusive discounts from partners recognized and reviewed for quality by Ladderly.io. The discounts there can save you thousands of dollars, time, effort, and even land you a guaranteed programming role! [Ladderly Perks](/perks) save time, money, and provide value through reduced risk.

The third benefit is the community Discord server, which can be joined from the Community dropdown in the site navigation. Since you're here, you can also just [click this link](https://discord.com/invite/fAg6Xa4uxc)!
