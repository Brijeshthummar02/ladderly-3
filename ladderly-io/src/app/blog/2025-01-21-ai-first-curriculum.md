This curriculum is designed to go hand-in-hand with Ladderly.io's [free standard checklist](https://www.ladderly.io/checklists/my-basic-checklist)!

It can be completed by most people in 3-24 months depending on whether it is pursued full-time or part-time and other factors.

Beyond this material, Ladderly.io offers a [premium checklist](https://www.ladderly.io/checklists/my-premium-checklist), individual coaching, and small-group coaching for even more effective and personalized outcomes! [Learn more here](https://www.ladderly.io/checklists/my-premium-checklist).

## Getting Started: Your First Day

Welcome to your journey into web development! Unlike traditional approaches, we'll start with three key foundations that will accelerate your learning journey: community engagement, hands-on project work, and AI-enhanced learning.

### 1. Join the Developer Community (Day 1, Morning)

Your first step is joining the Ladderly Discord community: <https://discord.com/invite/fAg6Xa4uxc>

Essential channels to engage with:

- **#introductions**: Introduce yourself and your goals
- **#general**: Engage in general discussion and stay updated
- **#programming-help**: Ask questions and help others
- Explore other channels that interest you!

Tips for effective community engagement:

- Share your learning journey
- Ask specific, well-formed questions
- Help others when you can
- Share resources you find helpful
- Build relationships with peer learners

### 2. Complete Your First Project (Day 1, Afternoon)

Instead of starting with theory, you'll build a real project on your first day! This "trial by fire" approach will:

- Give you hands-on experience
- Build your confidence
- Create your first portfolio piece
- Establish your GitHub presence

Follow along with the Trial by Fire project tutorial: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InK2ciIKs_Q>

Project Overview:

- Build a Vanilla Blog using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Create your GitHub account and first repository
- Publish your work online
- Estimated completion time: 2 hours

### 3. Learning Tools and Growth Mindset (Day 1, Evening)

Learn to accelerate your development using AI and search techniques while adopting a practical growth mindset:

Watch the comprehensive guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2-BF64-sGQ>

Key Mindset Principles:

- Focus on sufficiency over completeness
- Learn what you need, when you need it
- Identify and fill knowledge gaps as they become relevant
- Prioritize practical application over memorization
- Embrace "just-in-time" learning over "just-in-case" learning
- Learn in Public

Learning in Public:

- Share your journey from day one
- Create content about what you learn (even small wins!)
- Document your progress through:
  - LinkedIn posts
  - Twitter/X updates
  - Blog posts about your projects
  - GitHub commits and documentation
  - Discord community updates
- Your first post can be as simple as "Today I started my coding journey. I built my first HTML page and learned about [specific thing you learned]."
- Remember: Perfect is the enemy of done - share your progress, not perfection

Key skills you'll develop:

- Effective prompt engineering for coding assistance
- Strategic use of AI pair programming
- Advanced technical search techniques
- Documentation navigation
- Problem-solving patterns

## 4. Core Technical Path
