This article walks you through recommended practices for social and professional networking, including specific scripts or templates for messaging other professionals.

Ladderly.io also recommends content creation and community engagement as part of a social networking strategy. Read more in [Ladderly.io's Endorsed Communities Guide](/blog/2025-01-22-endorsed-communities)!

Ladderly.io recommends A/B testing these scripts with and without tailoring and variation, in order to find the best fit for you.
The goal of these scripts is to improve the odds of achieving any of several positive outcomes, including:

1. Obtaining an interview
2. Obtaining a new LinkedIn social connection
3. Obtaining a referral or reference
4. Obtaining general advice to facilitate job search, career growth, portfolio improvement, or skill improvement

## General Usage Guidance

1. Message people through LinkedIn by using "Add Note" when you send a connection request.

    a. Do NOT simply "Connect" and then send a message days later if they happen to accept your messageless request.

    b. Do modify templates as needed to respect the character limit of the Add Note feature. Casual expressions like "ur" over "you are" are fine.

2. "Punch up down and sideways" by connecting with people at, above, and below your level.
3. When you identify a target role, immediately send connection requests to multiple people at the company. Don't wait for one person to time out before connecting with others.
4. When you identify a target role, apply a 2 day timebox in order to seek a referral before applying. If you don't get a referral, apply anyway.

## The Three Strikes Rules

Ladderly recommends the three strikes rule for application follow-up. The three strikes rule itself has three pieces, described below.

### Three Strikes for a Role, not a Contact

This rule indicates that an individual should follow up three times before declining a job due to lack of employer responsiveness.

It is often inappropriate or suboptimal to message the same individual three times. Following up on a single job post three times may indicate two messages to a recruiter and one message to a hiring manager, for example.

Similarly, an unresponsive engineer may simply not be a frequent social media user. Following up with the engineer three times on the same role is not effective and possibly annoying.

Do follow up once with an unresponsive contact, but do message a different contact if the original contact remains unresponsive after a follow-up message.

Do note that the cadance of follow-up is important. Message only once per week. You may message once the same day that you apply, and you can even message two or three people on that same day, but do not follow up with a single contact until the following week and a minimum of three business days have elapsed.

For example, if I apply on a Friday, I can message a contact on the same day, but I should not follow up until the following Wednesday at the earliest. I should also not wait until after the following Friday to follow up.

### Three Strikes for a Company

Ladderly recommends applying for only one or two roles at a particular company at a time.

In rare cases, two roles may close out within the same job search, and the candidate may be eligible to apply again.

In these cases, do feel free to apply for more roles at that company, but Ladderly recommends a caveat: If the employer is unresponsive on three roles during a job search, reduce priority of applications at this employer.

### Three Strikes to Restore a Company

If an employer has been deprioritized for unresponsiveness, let's not deprioritize them for all time. Companies do change over time.

Remove deprioritization from an employer after the shorter time window among two options:

1. Eighteen Months
2. Three Job Search Cycles

On a related note, Ladderly recommends considering a new job search every six months, if for no other reason than to maintain interview skill.
