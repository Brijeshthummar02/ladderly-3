There are loads of ways for software engineers to debug.

This article describes four groups of tips and gives special notes focusing on commercial patterns
and debugging in the interview.

These debugging tips overlap with remediation, testing, and other practices.

## Seven Core Techniques

This section cuts across groups and gives you seven specific techniques in priority order. The purpose of this section is to enable immediate action over a deeper comprehensive dive, which will be given in subsequent sections.

For commercial debugging, pay particular attention to commercial strategies in addition to this section.

Later sections will elaborate on each item:

1. 17:03 - #1 Generative AI Tools (e.g., ChatGPT)

19:52 - #2 Boolean and Keyword Search (Google, DuckDuckGo, etc.)

23:29 - #3 Official Documentation (Programming libraries, certifications, legal codes)

26:09 - #4 Trusted Third-Party Sources (Stack Overflow, Mozilla, reputable blogs)

28:45 - #5 Reference Samples (Code repositories, business precedents)

30:29 - #6 Guess and Check (Debugging, troubleshooting, iterative experimentation)

32:13 - #7 Social Escalation and Consultation (When and how to ask for help)

## Search Strategies

Search is a general technique to acquire knowledge which is upstream of all hard and soft skill development.

Search is important for learning, development, and debugging remediation.

## Bug Prevention

## AI-Driven Debugging Tips and Vibe Coding Remediation

## Code-Based Debugging

Loggers + Breakpoints + Scripts (particularly for DB issues)

## Commercial Patterns

runbooks, commercial loggers, correlation IDs, health checks, commercial documentation practices / search strategies

when to spin up an incident (we don't dive deep into incident creation and handling, but it's important to be aware)

## Coding Interview Debugging
