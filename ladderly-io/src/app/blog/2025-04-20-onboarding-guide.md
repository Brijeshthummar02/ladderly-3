Onboarding rapidly empowers you to create impact rapidly and creates a positive impression that can carry over into added influence, effectiveness, positive performance reviews, ability to opt-in to projects of choice, higher job satisfaction, and faster career progress!

## Take Onboarding Notes

Many low-level tasks for onboarding are not routinely included in task tracking tools, but you will want to keep track. So create a personal Google Doc or a self-directed running email thread. Keep track of tasks in this document, and also note people of interest, terms, teams, technical conventions, and links to other documents and resources.

Understand conventions around task creation, estimation, execution, and definition of done. For programming tasks, check on code style and peer review process. Understand adjacent teams and components to your team. Identify clients, consumers, producers, customers, and other stakeholders. Understand your team's work intake process, if one is defined.

## Budget Your Time

Because you are operating outside of traditional task management software, it is important to deliberately manage your own time. This problem will likely fade in the course of a few sprints, and full capture of your work in the team's standard task tracking software is a great market that onboarding is largely complete.

As part of [managing your time](/blog/2025-04-18-time-management), implement email filters and aggressively archive emails. Implementing Inbox Zero at onboarding time may be more feasible than implementing it later on.

## Align with Your Manager

A good signal that you onboarded effectively will be when you first performance review goes well. Work backwards from that to get a view into what you should be doing now. Your manager controls your performance review, so you should prioritize their preferences.

As part of your initial onboarding notes, identify your manager's preferred communication style and cadence. If you are given an onboarding buddy or perhaps multiple individuals that you will work deeply with during your onboarding phase, get similar information from them. You are specifically looking to strike a balance between self-study and escalating help requests to others.

You should have a strong bias to autonomy and resist asking for help, but adjust this to accomodate the expectations of your manager and team. Instead of asking for answers, ask for tools, resources, and contacts. Set up intro meetings with relevant stakeholders. Use the [seven core search techniques](/blog/2025-03-30-debugging-tips#seven-core-search-techniques) and [commercial search patterns](/blog/2025-03-30-debugging-tips#commercial-patterns) to take full advantage of the enterprise knowledge stores you find.

Agree on a definition of done for onboarding. If you can onboard in a month, do so. If onboarding is expected to take multiple months, identify monthly goals. [A 30-60-90 Day Plan](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/starting-new-job/30-60-90-day-plan) is a common tool to consider. Once onboarding is complete, study up on quarterly and annual goals for your manager, company, and team. Understand the team's formal charter and your manager's personal goals. Identify the OKRs and North Stars that your team uses.

## Skip Irrelevant Meetings

As a new joiner, you may be invited to many team meetings that may be of low value to you. Talk one-on-one, not in a public forum, with your manager and fellow engineers to determine whether attendence is recommended for you.

## Update Something

Your goal is to onboard rapidly and begin delivering impact, but these are not optimally implemented in order. You can begin delivering impact during your onboarding period.

Don't fear making a trivial update. This is probably exactly what you should do. Update a document, a test, fix a lint rule, correct a spelling mistake, or make some other change which is low stakes. It is usually not a good idea to attempt to make a framework-level or major change during your onboarding period. If you see something strange, ask about it before you attempt to change it. There may be a good reason this pattern exists at the current company, even if it is atypical or non-preferred outside of the company.

Onboarding documentation improvements are a particularly good fit because you have just gone through the motions. Suggesting changes in an area of experience is typically a move that is welcomed by the team.
