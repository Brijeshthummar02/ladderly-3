[Research shows](https://www.mentorcliq.com/blog/mentoring-stats) that lack of mentorship is a major career challenge for many people, particularly for individuals from a nontraditional, minority, or disadvantaged background. On the other hand, effective utilization of mentors and career coaches leads to higher compensation, employment rate, promotion velocity, job satisfaction, and more!

This article explains how to find an effective mentor or career coach and provides awareness around particular services, tasks, and benefits that these folks can provide.

## List of Services

Mentors and career coaches can help with:

1. Interview preperation and practice interviews
2. Resume Review or Resume Creation
3. LinkedIn Profile Optimization
4. Skill development and LinkedIn skill endorsement
5. Portfolio review
6. Social networking assistance
7. Tailored job search advice
8. Technical assistance or general freelancing services
9. Improved on-the-job performance, PIP remediation, or accelerated promotion
10. Job offer negotiation
11. Assistance in job family change and general
12. Assistance with work-life balance and off-the-job skills such as time and stress management

Many career coaches and mentors have a particular specialization. Some will not be able to accomodate everything on this list while others will have additional talents and services not included in this list. If you aren't sure, just ask!

## How to Find a Mentor or Career Coach

There are two main ways to find a mentor or career coach, and Ladderly.io supports them both:

1. Social Networking
2. Fee for Service

You can directly book an expert session through Ladderly.io [here](https://buy.stripe.com/cN2bMfbOQ2CX5dC7su).

You can browse the [Ladderly Community](https://www.ladderly.io/community) for peers or individuals further along in their career. Many community members explicitly list networking interests and services offered.

You can add your own networking interests and services offered here on your [settings page](https://www.ladderly.io/settings)!

There are also marketplaces for mentors and career coaches outside of the Ladderly.io community. High-quality marketplaces are useful because they provide transparent ratings and pricing. Outside of the Ladderly.io platform, we recommend searching [MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/) for a mentor with 13 or more reviews and an average rating of 4.25 or better, which corresponds to the top quarter of engineering mentors on the site at the time of analysis.

Many companies offer internal mentorship programs and budget for employee training and education. Ask about these, and ask whether the training and education budget can be used to pay for a personalized mentorship or career coaching!

## Programs, Platforms, and Perks

If you are considering a fee for service, it often makes sense to purchase a platform or a program instead of hiring a career coach.

[Ladderly.io offers a number of discounts, or perks](https://www.ladderly.io/perks), for platforms and programs that we recommend for various use cases:
