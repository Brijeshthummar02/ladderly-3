Time management [enables higher productivity, better wellbeing, and lower stress](https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0245066.html0). Ladderly.io describes a comprehensive approach including 13 tools in [this free hour-long video time management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqRzvQ0Unc). The current article summarizes that video then incorporates insights from multiple well-regarded books and provides additional tips, more than doubling the overall number of strategies in a rapidly consumable format!

## Essentials of Time Management

[Ladderly.io's Essentials of Time Management video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqRzvQ0Unc) discusses strategies and mental models for maximizing value and achieving goals. The presenter, a staff software engineer with over 10 years of experience and a Ph.D. in economics, defines time management as the proper allocation of time to maximize value. He highlights 13 items for discussion, where each item is a tool, concept, technique, or family of techniques:

1. Time management is Budgeting: Plan weekly and block time on your calendar.
2. Make time by saying no and prioritizing
3. Follow a restful and healthy routine; more energy = more productivity = more time
4. Leverage the Traditional Routine (if possible)
   1. Task the 9-5 and the 5-9.
   2. Task six days each week.
   3. Recreation, rest, social engagement, and health activites are tasks. Plan them.
   4. Respect your circadian rhythm: Sleep at night.
5. Leverage your social network
6. Leverage seasonal planning, annual planning, and vacation/staycation/breaks
   1. To overcome big tasks without burnout using the cumulative interest of consistent effort.
   2. Also have a loose or general 3–5 year plan and life plan.
7. Mostly avoid working today. Do 1–3 things per day and 1–3 bigger things per year.
8. Remember the Triangle Strategy for Long-Term Impact
   1. During weekly planning, simultaneously consider short term and long term goals.
   2. Align tasks so that you efficiently walk the hypotenuse to long term impact.
9. Consider technical solutions like Agenda, doing things remotely, and apps like Poplin
10. Minimizing cooking time.
    1. Leverage healthy and premade food options like Kachava, which can be found at target.
    2. Don't feel bad about paying for fast food or delivery, even regularly.
    3. Consider intermittent fasting including the one meal a day diet.
11. Think in Chronos and Kairos time
    1. Chronos time is described in a calendar
    2. Kairos time is described in a directed graph
12. Single-tasking > multitasking, and intentional tasking > automatic behavior
    1. Intentional tasking for a few hard weeks can build a lifetime of positive habits!
13. Take the time value of money seriously, valuing your current and future self

There are 13 items included in the video and we will walk through each:

1. Opportunity Identification: Finding the right opportunities is crucial [03:57].
2. Prioritization Methods: 1. Eisenhower Matrix: Categorizing tasks by urgency and importance [04:31]. 2. ABC Method: Ranking tasks (though potentially less effective in professional settings) [06:19]. 3. Focus: Aiming to complete one to three important tasks per day [07:47].
   Return on Investment (ROI): Prioritizing based on ROI per effort, adjusted for risk [11:45].
3. Planning & Scheduling:
   1. Time as a Budget: Treating time like a financial budget [09:46].
   2. Weekly Planning: Setting aside time weekly for planning and using time blocking (e.g., with Google Calendar) [13:28].
   3. Time Blocking: Scheduling specific tasks in your calendar [23:35].
   4. Time Boxing: Setting time limits for tasks [31:18].
   5. Traditional Schedule Concept: Thinking of the week in terms of workdays (9-5, 5-9, rest) and weekends (rest/personal development) [15:12].
4. Goal Setting & Execution:
   1. SMART Goals: Ensuring goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound [19:13].
   2. Intentional Learning: Prioritizing active over passive learning [17:10].
   3. Triangle Mental Model: Considering the long-term impact of decisions [19:40].
   4. Consistent Effort: Recognizing that consistent effort leads to cumulative results [33:53].
   5. Six-Point Mental Model: Evaluating opportunities across products, people, principles, processes, and platforms [36:41].
5. Productivity Techniques:
   1. Pomodoro Technique: Using frequent breaks to maintain focus [27:23].
   2. Building Momentum: Starting with easier tasks [29:21].
   3. Todo Lists: Writing tasks down [26:02].
   4. Rewards: Motivating task completion with rewards [26:46].
   5. Single-tasking: Focusing on one task at a time [52:57].
6. Protecting Your Time: Delegate and Say No: Learning to decline requests to protect your time [32:34].
7. Well-being:
   1. Financial Budgeting: Managing finances reduces stress [24:18].
   2. Exercise: Regular exercise boosts productivity [25:04].
   3. Rest: Following a restful routine is important [47:40].
8. Other Concepts:
   1. Kronos vs. Kairos Time: Understanding clock time vs. the sequence of events [01:00:41].
   2. Intentional Tasking and deliberate work: Focusing intentionally rather than acting automatically [01:03:18].
9. Valuing Time: Recognizing the worth of your time [01:03:56].
10. Tools: Utilizing agendas, remote work, and apps can save time [57:44].
    The summary concludes with 13 key highlights covering planning, anticipating tasks, making time, routines, leveraging networks, seasonal planning, focus, task limits, single-tasking, assigning jobs to hours, goal planning, and valuing time [00:44:47 - 01:03:56].

## Insights from "Getting Things Done"

This section presents five time management tips derived from David Allen's book [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563). It is not a comprehensive summary. Overall, the process feels like a less-opinionated form of Agile with a few wrinkles:

1. A non-negotiable weekly reflection session.
2. Practicing mindfulness about own-motivation, energy, and focus, in order to incorporate those factors into selecting the best work item to process next.
3. Front-loading small tasks

Here are five techniques pulled from the book:

1. Get tasks out of your head and into a trusted system.
   1. David Allen's advice is tool-agnostic. There are purpose-built tools like [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/), but I have personally benefited from using a whiteboard, emailing myself, setting a phone alarm, or creating a calendar item over using Todoist (which ultimately became a calendar item generator for me).
   2. [Ladderly.io uses GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Vandivier/projects/1/views/1) for open source work. Getting your ideas into a trusted and public system is an even stronger incentive system for completion.
   3. When possible, use your enterprise work system to track all work you do, so you get credit for the work tasks you do.
2. Clarify and organize tasks
   1. When capturing a task, document the specific actions needed to achieve the task.
   2. If possible, create calendar appointments for tasks.
3. Reflect using a non-negotiable weekly
   1. Weekly, monthly, or at some other interval, take some time to reflect on your prior work interval and plan your next work interval.
   2. Compare your previously-planned work with the work completed. Use this information to help you plan the next interval in a realistic way.
   3. Reflect on your tasks which are not yet placed in the calendar and decide whether you are now able to create a proper appointment.
4. Mind your Energy Level
   1. Different tasks require different levels of activation energy, focus, and so on.
   2. If you find that you are highly energized and motivated one day, deliver additional tasks or swap in a high-effort task to enable you to buffer against low-energy risk later.
5. Try the 2-minute rule: If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.
   1. This practical tool saves you net time compared to accepting the overhead of putting many small tasks into a task management system.
   2. This technique sets you up psychologically for increased motivation going into larger tasks, since task completion improves mood and provides a feeling of accomplishment.

## Insights from "7 Habits of Highly Effective People"

[Stephen R. Covey's book](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519) is a standard recommendation in the business, leadership, and productivity genres. It emphasizes collaboration more than time management, but these concerns are related in the case of collaborative work. In this way, the book provides a useful complimentary perspective which reinforce techniques mentioned elsewhere.

The habits and our time management insights for them are as follows:

1. Be Proactive
   1. Prevention is more efficient in terms of effort and time than remediation.
   2. First-movers in a negotation are often able to accomplish more of what they want. Similarly, in a collaborative work situation, if you propose the plan then you get a double-benefit because you gain a leadership claim in the workstream while also being able to assign yourself work you are relatively competent in, rather than waiting to be assigned work by another party.
   3. A technique here is to keep a personal idea backlog and propose work to your team out of this backlog when opportunities arise. Using 1:1 meetings with [the Onion Strategy](/blog/2025-02-25-ballparking#the-onion-strategy) is a powerful augmentation to this approach.
2. Begin With the End in Mind
   1. This technique agrees with a major principle established in the current article across sections: Define a large, impactful goal and work backwards into small, actionable steps that can be executed immediately.
   2. This technique encourages you to work backwards from your personal life goal or mission, so a tactic is simply to write out a personal life goal or mission and re-evaluate it at least annually. Publicly declare this mission in your website and social media and seek work that aligns.
   3. This technique has a dual-benefit in that it helps shape a professional brand which can improve networking, job search performance, and authority, while also improving your performance and satisfaction at work and away from work by having you engage in something you care about beyond the paycheck or company in which you currently work.
3. Put First Things First. This principle reminds us to prioritize and schedule our work, accounting for dependencies between tasks.
4. Think Win-Win
5. Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
6. Synergize
7. Sharpen the Saw
   1. This habit is about preserving and enhancing ourselves.
   2. It encourages us to invest time and effort to intentionally heal and upskill with four explicit dimensions of self: body, heart, mind, and spirit.
   3. A technique for this habit is to ensure you have at least one task to rest or upskill in each of the four dimensions during your weekly personal reflection time.

## Inbox Zero

You can unlock time by implementing [Inbox Zero](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/inbox-zero) or something similar.

Inbox Zero is easy to implement as a new hire and hard to implement once your inbox is full. One approach to kicking off Inbox Zero after you already have a full inbox is to tag all emails in your inbox with a special tag like `before-inbox-zero` and perform a mass archive on them, knowing you can later look through the group by tag as needed.

Here are three more techniques to implement as part of an Inbox Zero approach:

1. Leverage an email client that is able to filter, label, and archive emails and make use of this feature to cut down on the number of emails that you need to review.
2. If work items need to be done, transfer the work into project management software and archive the email.
3. Set expectations with your team that you aggressively filter emails and prefer direct messages for urgent notes.

## Time Management Tips for Agile Business Process

1. Lumping, Slicing, and Timeboxing
   1. You should complete tasks each week. If you can't close multiple tickets each week, slice your scope more thinly.
   2. Creating tickets has overhead. If you regularly close three tickets per day, try to lump scope together.
   3. Proper scoping itself has an overhead. Start with the industry-standard approach of one planning day per sprint and A/B test alterations from there.
      1. Simlarly, when intaking a large work epic, create a task to design it, and use a single-day timebox as a baseline time allocation for a design spike.
      2. A/B testing a cadence optimizes for some group of people. When the group significantly changes, perhaps due to a re-org or new workstream involving a new cross-functional group, it may be worth re-evaluating the standard.
   4. Communication bottlenecks can be overcome by lumping multiple asks, sometimes even unrelated asks, into a single message or meeting.
2. Address Scope Creep with Prevention, Triage, and Queues
   1. The earlier-mentioned design spike should be able to establish workstream goals and non-goals, anticipate possible scope creep, and deal with it from a planning perspective before beginning implementation. If you notice your team consistently seeing unexpected scope creep, this is a signal that you should raise the design bar and perhaps allocate more than one day to design.
   2. When scope creep comes up, resists immediate execution. Pass it through an intake process which ensures the added work has high priority before executing. The default activity should be to document the new scope in a ticket and add it to the end of a queue for triage and possible implementation. In peer review, prefer requesting ticket creation over requesting changes to an active pull request when possible.
3. Transfer Scope with Influence, Delegation, and Enabling Self-Serve
   1. You don't need to execute work if you can convince other people to accept the work! Encourage other teams to publish an intake process. Study the code ownership, goals, and charters of teams across the company, and network to understand goals of individuals at the company. This situational awareness often provides a chance for you to pitch work to someone outside of your team.
   2. If your team has to do it, that doesn't mean you have to do it! For senior roles, practicing delegation is a matter of your role and your own skill growth. For non-seniors, receiving extra scope is a path to growth. As a team lead, prefer delegation when possible.
   3. No technical contributor needs to build the work if a self-serve solution is available. Consider this before accepting an intake request, and if you see many similar intake requests, consider implementing a generic solution with a self-serve capability for the request type.
4. Leverage Deadlines
   1. Work backwards from annual plans to quarterly and monthly goals.
   2. Self-impose monthly goals and use communication, meetings, and demos as forcing functions.
   3. If you get to a self-imposed deadline and you aren't ready, recycle the meeting into something useful or push back the deadline. Don't outright cancel.
