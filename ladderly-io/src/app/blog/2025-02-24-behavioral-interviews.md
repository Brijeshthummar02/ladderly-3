Behavioral interviews are a standard component of hiring at every tier of the programming industry. These rounds are often formally declared, but this style of question is common even in recruiter screens, conversational interviews like a [hiring manager interview](https://formation.dev/blog/how-to-pass-hiring-manager-interviews/), and ordinary conversations outside of an interview setting.

Preparing answers for this type of interview question will also benefit your social networking and job performance because:

1. Deliberate practice with communication of any kind of material improves general communication skill and confidence. These attributes are highly valuable and transferable into all performance domains including job performance, interview performance, and conversational skill in your personal life including networking situations.

2. Fluent storytelling of technical work accomplishments empowers your ability to lead, persuade, and influence on the job because. Describing a story of accomplishment and the way it relates to a new problem allows you to propose actions to your team in a way that naturally yields confidence in success. It worked once, so it can plausibly work again!

3. Fluent storytelling around a group of stories allows for the creation of a metastory between those stories. This allows you to generate a cohesive and powerful personal professional brand narrative, building additional authority, influence, and confidence in domains related to this narrative.

It is also important to note that a high-quality resume is aligned to these same stories of achievement. From a natural language perspective, a list of well-crafted behavioral interview stories can be directly distilled into a resume.

## Industry-Standard Advice

Amazon provides the industry-standard advice which is to use the STAR method, which stands for the following:

1. Situation
2. Task
3. Action
4. Result

Besides this standard advice, Amazon also evaluates candidates according to certain Amazon-specific behavioral and cultural values which they call the Leadership Principles. Unfortunately, there is no forcing function intrinisic to the STAR method which assures solving for the Leadership Principles, or for behavioral, cultural, and value signals more generally. Ladderly's `Advanced Behavioral Strategy` specifically solves this pain point and a few others, leading to highly differentiated behavioral interview performance for our members.

Meta provides a similar approach with a focus on the key pain point solved or obstacle resolved, using the SOAR acronym:

1. Situation
2. Obstacle
3. Action
4. Result

## Ladderly.io's Bar-Raising Advanced Behavioral Strategy

Ladderly.io's `Advanced Behavioral Strategy` involves merging the STAR and SOAR methods then adding four components:

1. Explicit Signals
2. Reflection
3. Tactical Usage
4. Tactical Preperation

So, a list of stories following Ladderly.io's format will use the acronym STOARR, also called the `Pirate Store Method`:

1. Situation
2. Task
3. Obstacle
4. Action
5. Result
6. Reflection
   1. For each story, tag it with a list of 1-5 engineering values that you believe the story demonstrates.
   2. Start by tagging stories with the list of signals from [Formation's Valued Engineer Traits](https://formation.dev/blog/how-to-pass-behavioral-interviews-understanding-valued-engineer-traits/) and [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles).
   3. Later, you can collect company-specific value tags to your stories as you research various companies.

Why call it the `Pirate Store Method`? A few reasons:

1. The notion of a pirate emphasizes the ending with multiple instances of the letter 'r'.
2. It's memorable and facilitates memes!

## STOARR Template

[Here is a STOARR template Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UlznIV_aRWZLup2wt6iRklkUcld9D_K-rUXJYKbYDwo) which includes a few example stories. You can use this as a personal or language model reference to assist in formatting structured stories from raw notes.

## Story Generation

Ladderly.io recommends creating a [Google Doc](https://docs.new) to track your stories.

While on the job, story material is generated every sprint. It is a good practice to keep a Brag Sheet or a running document of accomplishments. You can also query your project management software for tasks completed, consult notes from meetings, and even search the codebase for changes you made to mine stories retrospectively if you have forgotten.

Some pain points occur when you haven't been at a company for a while. Here are a few strategies to mine stories in this case:

1. Don't worry about weekly or monthly accomplishments. Simply try to recall one story per quarter.
2. Contact a prior coworker to see if they are open to a chat which might jog your memory or if they would even be willing to query project management software or version control for you.
3. Leverage ballparking to establish impact. Estimating measures is fine when you no longer have access to exact data. This technique is developed in detail in blog article [22. Ballparking Project Impact](/blog/2025-02-25-ballparking).

Even if you have professional experience, you may benefit from creating even more stories outside of this professional experience.

### Without Professional Experience

If you have zero professional programming experience, derive stories from:

1. Open source projects
2. Non-programming employment
3. School projects

Ladderly.io recommends building a list of 5-10 stories, then sorting them by impact and biasing towards telling the most impactful stories in the interview. A candidate might like to tell the story which most directly answers the question, but an advanced technique is to redirect to a story with high impact even if it is not the most directly related. Like much of the behavioral interview, this verbal technique becomes easier with practice.

You should still ensure you answer the question, but you shouldn't constrain yourself to always pick the most direct answer to the question when another story is still good enough and does a much better job of showcasing your scope, skill, and impact.

Start by creating a baseline list of 5 stories and add additional stories as they come up over time with impact better than the weakest item on your list. No story is too small! Even with zero professional experience you can come up with 5 or more stories in the course of a month by building projects with proper instrumentation and capturing metrics.

### 10 Example Metrics

Here is a list of achievements, some small, some large, but the point is to start by creating aas:

1. Improved latency or speed (offline tasks like build time count!)
2. Improved website traffic
3. Improved test coverage
4. Simplified components (by component count, lines of code)
5. Generated revenue
6. Generated revenue drivers (even just social media views and followers!)
7. Reduced cost
8. Improved accuracy
9. Saved time
10. Improved satisfaction (of users, fellow contributors, or any stakeholder)

### The Leadership Snowball

Accomplishments can open the door to bigger accomplishments by building trust with your team. In some cases, your team will watch you work and develop trust in your future actions autonomously. In most cases, however, you will build trust by advocating for yourself strategically.

Strategic advocacy can happen at any time, but there is an early mover advantage to those who can propose solutions early in the problem lifecycle, because once an organization begins to implement a particular solution there is high costs of switching.

With the early mover advantage in mind, strategic advocacy includes three preliminary steps:

1. Situational awareness: You need to be aware of a pain point to solve it. Achieve this by attending important meetings, conducting 1:1s across the company, and getting into the technical weeds on a regular basis.

2. Self-prioritization: You will become aware of many pain points and you shouldn't seek to solve them all. Target 1-3 items at a time, and only target a new opportunity if it appears more valuable than another one on your list, in which case you should drop the other one.

3. Proposal: Finally, you present a proposal to some stakeholders. Proposals come in many forms and this article won't detail the various tradeoffs. The key insight in this article is to include a reference to your prior accomplishments as part of the proposal in order to build trust and confidence with your team.

By repeatedly applying this loop to incrementally larger and more valuable opportunities over time, you will create a positive feedback loop and accrue a kind of social capital that enables you to perform at an increasingly higher level over time, without needing to work harder or longer. You can scale yourself to higher impact with this kind of leadership and influence snowball.

## Tactical Preparation

After constructing [a list of STOARR anecdotes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UlznIV_aRWZLup2wt6iRklkUcld9D_K-rUXJYKbYDwo), prepare for company interviews with two steps:

1. Research the company and obtain a list of engineering and cultural values at the company. With a bit of research or by asking current employees, you may even be able to access the official leveling matrix at the company!
2. Practice the behavioral interview, specifically incorporating company-specific value into the reflection step.

How should you practice? Here are five general principles:

1. Speak your solutions outloud
2. Filter filler words
3. Deliver the initial story in 3 minutes
4. Anticipate follow-up questions
5. Practice with volume, checking for weekly improvement or seeking help if a stubborn plateau is encountered

Here are five specific modes of practice, in approximate order of increasing utility:

1. Flashcard-style LLM Practice: Provide the LLM context on the company and ask it to give you behavioral interview questions. Don't walk through the whole story, but simply practice matching quickly to the story that you would tell.

2. Shadow interviews with an LLM. Provide an LLM the context for the company and ask it to give you behavioral interviews, acting as an interviewer. Use voice mode to speak out your full answer. Practice omitting filler words. At the end, ask it to grade your answer on a scale from 1 to 10 and provide feedback on what to do better.

3. Practice interview with a real programmer

4. Practice interview with a programmer that has experience conducting interviews at your target company. Interviewing.io is a great resource for FAANG interview preperation in this regard.

5. Have real interviews. A real interview at one company is extremely good practice for real interviews at other companies, even though valued engineering traits and cultural values may differ. For this reason, Ladderly.io encourages the `Snowball Method` for the job search. Interview at less-preferred companies early in the process to provide practice and potentially even generating offers. Not only does this improve your interview performance through repitition, it may also generate an offer which can allow you to negotiate higher compensation, prevent lowballing, and generate confidence through demonstrated success.

## Tactical Delivery

For this section on tactical STOARR anecdote usage, imagine that you are already in an interview round.

1. When receiving a question, first pause to show the interviewer that you are thinking. It's fine to take several seconds to think. Then smile and introduce the situation.

2. To comfortably introduce the situation, use a standard template:

   1. Standard prefix: "When I think about this question and my experience, I think a great story to tell is..."
   2. Introduce the year, quarter, company, team, and project title: "from 2022 in Q3, when I was working at Capital One. I was working in the CreditWise team on the COVID Information Rollout Project."
   3. Optionally give an overview of the scope and size of the company and team: "At this time, the CreditWise application had about 30 million monthly active users."

3. Now describe the task that you were supposed to complete and emphasize the pain point of an obstacle encountered.

   1. Emphasize why this task is considered difficult and important. Besides the metrics, we want to create an emotionally engaging story.
   2. Unexpected wrinkles and urgent deadlines are examples of sources of pain and frustration that might complicate an otherwise straightforward task and make the story more emotionally engaging and relatable to the interviewer, triggering empathy and helping them understand the impact of your action.

4. Now describe the action(s) you took to solve the problem.

   1. Sometimes an action leads to a wrinkle. Mentioning one of these is fine but it's not necessary to review multiple complications. You can simply mention if there were more and they can dive deeper during follow-up questions.
   2. Try to get through your story including reflection in 3 minutes, leaving time for follow-up questions.

5. Describe the result including 1-3 [SMART metrics](https://www.sopact.com/guides/smart-metrics), or quantifiable results that demonstrate business value.

   1. If your primary metric is technical, such as a CICD performance improvement, adding a second metric that translates this into clear business value often improves the overall quality of the story. If CICD performance saves engineering time, you can ballpark a financial figure by estimating "Approximately what does an engineering hour cost at this company or in this industry?"

   2. Limit to 3 metrics because you want to move on quickly and not overwhelm the interviewer. If you have more, simply say "I have some other results metrics that I can walk you through if you're curious and time allows." In this way you can steer follow-up questions and further improve your demonstrated impact for a double-benefit!

6. Add a reflection step:

   1. "With the benefit of hindsight, one thing I would have done differently is..."
   2. Finish with a positive affirmation of a relevant signal. "Overall, I like this story because I think it demonstrates my ability to handle complex but impactful UI changes under a tight deadline."
   3. Reflection should take under 20 seconds and it can greatly differentiate your story from the competition.
