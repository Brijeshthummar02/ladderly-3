Time management [enables higher productivity, better wellbeing, and lower stress](https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0245066.html0). Ladderly.io provides [this free hour-long video deep-dive on time management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqRzvQ0Unc). The current article summarizes that video and adds additional techniques from other sources for an even more comprehensive approach in a rapidly consumable format!

## Essentials of Time Management

[Ladderly.io's Essentials of Time Management video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqRzvQ0Unc) discusses strategies and mental models for maximizing value and achieving goals. The presenter, a staff software engineer with over 10 years of experience and a Ph.D. in economics, defines time management as the proper allocation of time to maximize value. He highlights 13 items for discussion, where each item is a tool, concept, technique, or family of techniques:

1. Plan Weekly
2. Make Time by Saying No and Prioritizing
3. Leverage the Traditional Routine
4.

There are 13 items included in the video and we will walk through each:

1. Opportunity Identification: Finding the right opportunities is crucial [03:57].
2. Prioritization Methods: 1. Eisenhower Matrix: Categorizing tasks by urgency and importance [04:31]. 2. ABC Method: Ranking tasks (though potentially less effective in professional settings) [06:19]. 3. Focus: Aiming to complete one to three important tasks per day [07:47].
   Return on Investment (ROI): Prioritizing based on ROI per effort, adjusted for risk [11:45].
3. Planning & Scheduling:
   1. Time as a Budget: Treating time like a financial budget [09:46].
   2. Weekly Planning: Setting aside time weekly for planning and using time blocking (e.g., with Google Calendar) [13:28].
   3. Time Blocking: Scheduling specific tasks in your calendar [23:35].
   4. Time Boxing: Setting time limits for tasks [31:18].
   5. Traditional Schedule Concept: Thinking of the week in terms of workdays (9-5, 5-9, rest) and weekends (rest/personal development) [15:12].
4. Goal Setting & Execution:
   1. SMART Goals: Ensuring goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound [19:13].
   2. Intentional Learning: Prioritizing active over passive learning [17:10].
   3. Triangle Mental Model: Considering the long-term impact of decisions [19:40].
   4. Consistent Effort: Recognizing that consistent effort leads to cumulative results [33:53].
   5. Six-Point Mental Model: Evaluating opportunities across products, people, principles, processes, and platforms [36:41].
5. Productivity Techniques:
   1. Pomodoro Technique: Using frequent breaks to maintain focus [27:23].
   2. Building Momentum: Starting with easier tasks [29:21].
   3. Todo Lists: Writing tasks down [26:02].
   4. Rewards: Motivating task completion with rewards [26:46].
   5. Single-tasking: Focusing on one task at a time [52:57].
6. Protecting Your Time: Delegate and Say No: Learning to decline requests to protect your time [32:34].
7. Well-being:
   1. Financial Budgeting: Managing finances reduces stress [24:18].
   2. Exercise: Regular exercise boosts productivity [25:04].
   3. Rest: Following a restful routine is important [47:40].
8. Other Concepts:
   1. Kronos vs. Kairos Time: Understanding clock time vs. the sequence of events [01:00:41].
   2. Intentional Tasking and deliberate work: Focusing intentionally rather than acting automatically [01:03:18].
9. Valuing Time: Recognizing the worth of your time [01:03:56].
10. Tools: Utilizing agendas, remote work, and apps can save time [57:44].
    The summary concludes with 13 key highlights covering planning, anticipating tasks, making time, routines, leveraging networks, seasonal planning, focus, task limits, single-tasking, assigning jobs to hours, goal planning, and valuing time [00:44:47 - 01:03:56].

## Inbox Zero

You can unlock time by implementing [Inbox Zero](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/inbox-zero) or something similar.

Inbox Zero is easy to implement as a new hire and hard to implement once your inbox is full. One approach to kicking off Inbox Zero after you already have a full inbox is to tag all emails in your inbox with a special tag like `before-inbox-zero` and perform a mass archive on them, knowing you can later look through the group by tag as needed.

Leverage an email client that is able to filter, label, and archive emails and make use of this feature to cut down on the number of emails that you need to review. If work items need to be done, transfer the work into project management software and archive the email. Set expectations with your team that you aggressively filter emails and prefer direct messages for urgent notes.

## Time Management Tips for Agile Business Process

1. Lumping, Slicing, and Timeboxing
   1. You should complete tasks each week. If you can't close multiple tickets each week, slice your scope more thinly.
   2. Creating tickets has overhead. If you regularly close three tickets per day, try to lump scope together.
   3. Proper scoping itself has an overhead. Start with the industry-standard approach of one planning day per sprint and A/B test alterations from there.
      1. Simlarly, when intaking a large work epic, create a task to design it, and use a single-day timebox as a baseline time allocation for a design spike.
      2. A/B testing a cadence optimizes for some group of people. When the group significantly changes, perhaps due to a re-org or new workstream involving a new cross-functional group, it may be worth re-evaluating the standard.
   4. Communication bottlenecks can be overcome by lumping multiple asks, sometimes even unrelated asks, into a single message or meeting.
2. Address Scope Creep with Prevention, Triage, and Queues
   1. The earlier-mentioned design spike should be able to establish workstream goals and non-goals, anticipate possible scope creep, and deal with it from a planning perspective before beginning implementation. If you notice your team consistently seeing unexpected scope creep, this is a signal that you should raise the design bar and perhaps allocate more than one day to design.
   2. When scope creep comes up, resists immediate execution. Pass it through an intake process which ensures the added work has high priority before executing. The default activity should be to document the new scope in a ticket and add it to the end of a queue for triage and possible implementation. In peer review, prefer requesting ticket creation over requesting changes to an active pull request when possible.
3. Transfer Scope with Influence, Delegation, and Enabling Self-Serve
   1. You don't need to execute work if you can convince other people to accept the work! Encourage other teams to publish an intake process. Study the code ownership, goals, and charters of teams across the company, and network to understand goals of individuals at the company. This situational awareness often provides a chance for you to pitch work to someone outside of your team.
   2. If your team has to do it, that doesn't mean you have to do it! For senior roles, practicing delegation is a matter of your role and your own skill growth. For non-seniors, receiving extra scope is a path to growth. As a team lead, prefer delegation when possible.
   3. No technical contributor needs to build the work if a self-serve solution is available. Consider this before accepting an intake request, and if you see many similar intake requests, consider implementing a generic solution with a self-serve capability for the request type.
4. Leverage Deadlines
   1. Work backwards from annual plans to quarterly and monthly goals.
   2. Self-impose monthly goals and use communication, meetings, and demos as forcing functions.
   3. If you get to a self-imposed deadline and you aren't ready, recycle the meeting into something useful or push back the deadline. Don't outright cancel.
