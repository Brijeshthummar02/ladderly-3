Time management [enables higher productivity, better wellbeing, and lower stress](https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0245066.html0). Ladderly.io describes a comprehensive approach including 13 tools in [this free hour-long video time management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqRzvQ0Unc). The current article summarizes that video then incorporates insights from multiple well-regarded books and provides additional tips, more than doubling the overall number of strategies in a rapidly consumable format!

## Essentials of Time Management

[Ladderly.io's Essentials of Time Management video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haqRzvQ0Unc) discusses strategies and mental models for maximizing value and achieving goals. The presenter, a staff software engineer with over 10 years of experience and a Ph.D. in economics, defines time management as the proper allocation of time to maximize value. He highlights 13 items for discussion, where each item is a tool, concept, technique, or family of techniques:

### Time Management is Budgeting

Ladderly.io encourages you to perform a weekly time budget. [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law) states that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. We can solve this problem by giving every hour a job, similar to a zero-based budgeting method.

Estimate your tasks and assign them to days then block off time in your calendar at the start of the week.

Part of this weekly time budget session will involve ideating and refining tasks into well-described and actionable tasks. Let's call the full list of your ideas and tasks the backlog, which is the standard term in Agile, a particular commercial task execution framework. If you have ideated properly through the end of the quarter, much less the end of the year and beyond, most of your backlog will not fit in your weekly schedule.

So how do we decide which items to execute this week? We use prioritization.

#### Prioritizing by Eisenhower Matrix

In this approach we classify tasks as relatively high or low importance and high or low urgency. We think take the following actions:

1. High importance, high urgency: Execute now
2. High importance, low urgency: Plan
3. Low importance, high urgency: Delegate
4. Low importance, low urgency: Eliminate.

Strictly followed, this can easily result in identifying an infeasibly large number of tasks for immediate execution with no way to sort inside the group to be executed immediately. Loosely followed, this makes an solid triage framework, and other processes can be applied by quadrant to further refine final execution plans.

#### Prioritizing by ROI

Ladderly.io's preferred technique is to sort tasks by return on investment, adjusted for risk. Investment in this context includes cost, time, and effort. This technique facilitates business case creation which is useful for stakeholder buy-in among other reasons. This technique also forces the scheduler to establish measures and estimates of outcome value, so it becomes a forcing-function for intaking demonstrably valuable work.

In practical application, Ladderly.io recommends two modifications to this approach:

1. If the cost of ROI estimation is higher than the time to execute, just execute the task.
2. Re-order tasks to account for topological dependencies and urgency.

#### Antipatterns: ABC and Ivy Lee Methods

The ABC pattern is a bucketing approach which may be more convenient for estimation. The scheduler simply buckets tasks into some number of buckets, where A-rank tasks are considered the best opportunities.

The Ivy Leed method encourages you to choose some number of A-rank tasks per day.

The problem with these approaches is that bucket sorting is imprecise relative to ROI calculation and any fixed number of tasks per day may not be feasible.

### Make Time by Saying No

If you budgeted your time, then you will have a backlog of tasks. When an intake requests comes in, Ladderly.io encourages you to place requests at the back of your work queue by default. This aligns with Cal Newport's fantastic book [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692).

Because you have a queue full of work with demonstrated business value, when folks seek to escalate work requests with urgency then they need to prove their request has a high level of value and urgency, otherwise they go to the back of the line.

As you iteratively re-plan your work you may notice groups of similar tasks scattered across the queue. In this case you can consider implementing a self-serve solution and, once ready, asking stakeholders to resolve additional tasks themselves.

Self-serve, scope transfer to another team, and deprioritization are soft ways of rejecting work, but you can also directly and firmly reject a change request in cases where a request is a documented non-goal for your team and its components.

### Be Healthy

Time management cannot be decoupled from productivity. When you budget your time, there is some implied rate of productivity. In this way, investing in productivity is an approach to making time.

Health, rest, and nutrition are foundational to productivity. A consistent sleep schedule that respects your circadian rhythm, regular physical activity, and healthy eating habits all feed your ability to perform.

### Leverage the Traditional Routine

The Traditional Routine is healthy and evolved for compatibility with your circadian rhythm. It is also efficient because it is socially normative, so it works efficiently with the schedules of others.

The traditional routine is:

1. Formal work from 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday.
2. Nights and weekends for personal activities.
3. Rest on Sunday.

We can abstract this routine slightly to make it more flexible and ensure that every hour gets a job:

1. Task 9 AM to 9 PM, six days each week.
2. Rest at night.
3. Leave one unstructured day each week.

Tasks include deliberate work, recreation, social activities, and healthcare.

### Leverage Your Social Network

Other people can be part of your time management strategy. This includes asking for help, outsourcing tasks, trading favors, or simply enlisting accountability partners. If a family member can babysit, a friend can help with errands, or a coworker can share resources, you're multiplying your effectiveness.

### Seasonal, Annual, and Life Planning

You should allocate planning time to perform your time budget once each week. Ideally, your weekly tasks are simultaneously planned with an iterative reflection on your long term goals. This is called the Triangle Strategy, because walking along the hypotenuse to your long term goals is more efficient than walking along the edges.

Seasons have unique characteristics as do quarters and years. If you can continuously account for all of this on a weekly basis, fantastic! Practically, however, many people benefit from carving out additional designated planning time for these multi-week cycles.

As part of your long-term planning, consider creating quarterly, annual, three-year, five-year, and lifetime goals. At each stage, Ladderly.io suggests including SMART goals alongside a mission. SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

### Do One Extra Thing

Distraction reduces productivity. Task queues solve this by providing focus, but our queue of tasks can't be accomplished in one day. This becomes overwhelming and stressful to some, and for others it can trigger workaholism.

A solution to both problems is to have a daily queue-stopping condition. The simplist possible condition is simply to do one task each day, but this doesn't account for the reality that we have many tasks that simply keep our life maintaned and stable, as distinct from tasks which make forward progress towards new goals. Doing dishes, laundry, filling the car with gas, and grocery shopping are example maintenence tasks.

The mental model that we should strive to do one thing beyond maintenence is a simple rule which strikes a balance between motivating forward progress and mitigating burnout, workaholism, and anxiety.

If you have loads of motivation and energy, feel free to do more, but don't feel obligated. Craft longer term plans with this conservative rule in place.

### Use Technology

Improvements to technology allow increased output without increased labor. So, we save time by using technologies appropriate to the tasks we are taking on.

During your weekly planning time, spend a bit of time researching technologies for the tasks you have coming up. New tools come out frequently. Poplin is a mobile app for laundry wash, dry, pickup, and delivery, which is an example of saving time through technology. Ladderly.io has a [discount for Poplin on our perks page](https://www.ladderly.io/perks)!

Technology means more than software. Simply changing your communication strategy could be considered a kind of technology. Technology includes new ideas and techniques that you can sometimes implement at zero cost. Ensuring every meeting you attend has an agenda is a simple example of a process change which can be thought of as a zero cost technology that results in saving time.

### Minimize Cooking

Daily chores like cooking can eat up large chunks of time. If it fits your budget, simplify or outsource these tasks. Healthy pre-made food options (e.g., Ka'Chava at Target), meal kits, delivery, and fast food can be worthwhile if they save hours each week. Intermittent fasting protocols such as a One Meal a Day (OMAD) can save time spent on food prep and cleanup. They can also save you dollars and help you control weight!

### Think in Chronos and Kairos time

Chronos time, or metric time, is described in a calendar. Kairos time is a series or directed graph of events. Both matter. You should be aware of the hours in the day and how you're spending them, and also thinking through each step you are taking and what is unlocks. This concept reiterates the importance of planning in terms of decision trees, backup plans, and topology, rather than a simple mapping of required to available time.

### Deliberate Single-Tasking and Habit Hacking

Multitasking lowers performance. Instead, aim to single-task and stay fully engaged. Research shows that active and deliberate learning lead to skill acquisition far more effectively than passive activities like background learning from a podcast.

You can mitigate automatic or non-deliberate action by interrupting yourself. To support focus, try the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Tinker with the intervals to suit your needs.

Habits are a special case of automatic or non-deliberate action because you can build positive habits that improve your overall performance across domains. Performing similar activities at similar times of day is an example of this.

### Value Your Future Self

Humans have a tendancy to procrastinate and delay, pushing work into the future. If you have a certain set of goals in a certain period, pushing work later means you are setting yourself up for cramming and pain towards the end of the period. As you consider the importance of sustainable practice and rest, remember that you will need rest in the future too.

Remembering the time value of money and the power of cumulative interest may help motivate you to do more work now, even beyond the avoidance of future pain. If you are holding a certain amount of cash and you invest it now or later, every moment you wait deteriorates the value of that cash by inflation and incurs opportunity cost in missed investment interest. You can view tasks similarly. With an extra hour of work, you could have earned some money and invested it. The opportunity cost over time is exponential, not linear.

Procrastination is particularly problematic for certain kinds of tasks which benefit from consistency over time, such as exercise, building habits, and building relationships.

## Insights from "Getting Things Done"

This section presents five time management tips derived from David Allen's book [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563). It is not a comprehensive summary. Overall, the process feels like a less-opinionated form of Agile with a few wrinkles:

1. A non-negotiable weekly reflection session.
2. Practicing mindfulness about own-motivation, energy, and focus, in order to incorporate those factors into selecting the best work item to process next.
3. Front-loading small tasks

Here are five techniques pulled from the book:

1. Get tasks out of your head and into a trusted system.
   1. David Allen's advice is tool-agnostic. There are purpose-built tools like [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/), but I have personally benefited from using a whiteboard, emailing myself, setting a phone alarm, or creating a calendar item over using Todoist (which ultimately became a calendar item generator for me).
   2. [Ladderly.io uses GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Vandivier/projects/1/views/1) for open source work. Getting your ideas into a trusted and public system is an even stronger incentive system for completion.
   3. When possible, use your enterprise work system to track all work you do, so you get credit for the work tasks you do.
2. Clarify and organize tasks
   1. When capturing a task, document the specific actions needed to achieve the task.
   2. If possible, create calendar appointments for tasks.
3. Reflect using a non-negotiable weekly session
   1. Weekly, monthly, or at some other interval, take some time to reflect on your prior work interval and plan your next work interval.
   2. Compare your previously-planned work with the work completed. Use this information to help you plan the next interval in a realistic way.
   3. Reflect on your tasks which are not yet placed in the calendar and decide whether you are now able to create a proper appointment.
4. Mind your Energy Level
   1. Different tasks require different levels of activation energy, focus, and so on.
   2. If you find that you are highly energized and motivated one day, deliver additional tasks or swap in a high-effort task to enable you to buffer against low-energy risk later.
5. Try the 2-minute rule: If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.
   1. This practical tool saves you net time compared to accepting the overhead of putting many small tasks into a task management system.
   2. This technique sets you up psychologically for increased motivation going into larger tasks, since task completion improves mood and provides a feeling of accomplishment.

## Insights from "7 Habits of Highly Effective People"

[Stephen R. Covey's book](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/0743269519) is a standard recommendation in the business, leadership, and productivity genres. It emphasizes collaboration more than time management, but these concerns are related in the case of collaborative work. In this way, the book provides a useful complimentary perspective which reinforce techniques mentioned elsewhere.

The habits and our time management insights for them are as follows:

1. Be Proactive
   1. Prevention is more efficient in terms of effort and time than remediation.
   2. First-movers in a negotation are often able to accomplish more of what they want. Similarly, in a collaborative work situation, if you propose the plan then you get a double-benefit because you gain a leadership claim in the workstream while also being able to assign yourself work you are relatively competent in, rather than waiting to be assigned work by another party.
   3. A technique here is to keep a personal idea backlog and propose work to your team out of this backlog when opportunities arise. Using 1:1 meetings with [the Onion Strategy](/blog/2025-02-25-ballparking#the-onion-strategy) is a powerful augmentation to this approach.
2. Begin With the End in Mind
   1. This technique agrees with a major principle established in the current article across sections: Define a large, impactful goal and work backwards into small, actionable steps that can be executed immediately.
   2. This technique encourages you to work backwards from your personal life goal or mission, so a tactic is simply to write out a personal life goal or mission and re-evaluate it at least annually. Publicly declare this mission in your website and social media and seek work that aligns.
   3. This technique has a dual-benefit in that it helps shape a professional brand which can improve networking, job search performance, and authority, while also improving your performance and satisfaction at work and away from work by having you engage in something you care about beyond the paycheck or company in which you currently work.
3. Put First Things First. This principle reminds us to prioritize and schedule our work, accounting for dependencies between tasks.
4. Think Win-Win
5. Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
   1. Plans that grapple with the empirical reality of the actual world and the specific preferences and perceptions of stakeholders are set up for success over axiomatic or armchair designs.
   2. Welcome feedback but not interruption or mischaracterization. Ensure stakeholders actually understand you before solving for differences.
6. Synergize
   1. Understand yourself and your team. Assign tasks accounting for relative strengths and weaknesses or specialization.
7. Sharpen the Saw
   1. This habit is about preserving and enhancing ourselves.
   2. It encourages us to invest time and effort to intentionally heal and upskill with four explicit dimensions of self: body, heart, mind, and spirit.
   3. A technique for this habit is to ensure you have at least one task to rest or upskill in each of the four dimensions during your weekly personal reflection time.

## Inbox Zero

You can unlock time by implementing [Inbox Zero](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/inbox-zero) or something similar.

Inbox Zero is easy to implement as a new hire and hard to implement once your inbox is full. One approach to kicking off Inbox Zero after you already have a full inbox is to tag all emails in your inbox with a special tag like `before-inbox-zero` and perform a mass archive on them, knowing you can later look through the group by tag as needed.

Here are three more techniques to implement as part of an Inbox Zero approach:

1. Leverage an email client that is able to filter, label, and archive emails and make use of this feature to cut down on the number of emails that you need to review.
2. If work items need to be done, transfer the work into project management software and archive the email.
3. Set expectations with your team that you aggressively filter emails and prefer direct messages for urgent notes.

## Time Management Tips for Agile Business Process

1. Lumping, Slicing, and Timeboxing
   1. You should complete tasks each week. If you can't close multiple tickets each week, slice your scope more thinly.
   2. Creating tickets has overhead. If you regularly close three tickets per day, try to lump scope together.
   3. Proper scoping itself has an overhead. Start with the industry-standard approach of one planning day per sprint and A/B test alterations from there.
      1. Simlarly, when intaking a large work epic, create a task to design it, and use a single-day timebox as a baseline time allocation for a design spike.
      2. A/B testing a cadence optimizes for some group of people. When the group significantly changes, perhaps due to a re-org or new workstream involving a new cross-functional group, it may be worth re-evaluating the standard.
   4. Communication bottlenecks can be overcome by lumping multiple asks, sometimes even unrelated asks, into a single message or meeting.
2. Address Scope Creep with Prevention, Triage, and Queues
   1. The earlier-mentioned design spike should be able to establish workstream goals and non-goals, anticipate possible scope creep, and deal with it from a planning perspective before beginning implementation. If you notice your team consistently seeing unexpected scope creep, this is a signal that you should raise the design bar and perhaps allocate more than one day to design.
   2. When scope creep comes up, resists immediate execution. Pass it through an intake process which ensures the added work has high priority before executing. The default activity should be to document the new scope in a ticket and add it to the end of a queue for triage and possible implementation. In peer review, prefer requesting ticket creation over requesting changes to an active pull request when possible.
3. Transfer Scope with Influence, Delegation, and Enabling Self-Serve
   1. You don't need to execute work if you can convince other people to accept the work! Encourage other teams to publish an intake process. Study the code ownership, goals, and charters of teams across the company, and network to understand goals of individuals at the company. This situational awareness often provides a chance for you to pitch work to someone outside of your team.
   2. If your team has to do it, that doesn't mean you have to do it! For senior roles, practicing delegation is a matter of your role and your own skill growth. For non-seniors, receiving extra scope is a path to growth. As a team lead, prefer delegation when possible.
   3. No technical contributor needs to build the work if a self-serve solution is available. Consider this before accepting an intake request, and if you see many similar intake requests, consider implementing a generic solution with a self-serve capability for the request type.
4. Leverage Deadlines
   1. Work backwards from annual plans to quarterly and monthly goals.
   2. Self-impose monthly goals and use communication, meetings, and demos as forcing functions.
   3. If you get to a self-imposed deadline and you aren't ready, recycle the meeting into something useful or push back the deadline. Don't outright cancel.

## Be a Ghost

A family of additional time saving techniques for you and your team is to enable ghosting. You can be a ghost in your team, or you can actually champion a ghost culture. Ghosting is a loose way of describing not showing up to a meeting and appearing to be absent or offline (even if you are actually present and working).

Here are some specific ghosting techniques:

1. **Manage Notifications Aggressively**
   - Turn off notifications in apps that aren't essential to your current focus
   - Aggressively "turn off notifications for replies" in Slack, LinkedIn, and other platforms once you've accomplished your goal in a conversation
   - Configure work hours and snooze notifications outside of those hours

2. **Become Strategically Unavailable**
   - When in focus time, mark yourself as away or unavailable in tools like Slack
   - Consider blocking focus time on your calendar as "busy" to prevent meeting invites
   - Use the "Do Not Disturb" feature on your operating system and phone during deep work sessions

3. **Communication Minimalism**
   - Resist the urge to have the last word in conversations
   - Use emoji reactions (like a simple thumbs up) to acknowledge messages without starting new threads
   - Leverage asynchronous communication over meetings whenever possible
   - Keep messages concise and directly actionable

4. **Meeting Efficiency**
   - End meetings early when objectives are met
   - Don't hesitate to leave meetings when your presence is no longer required
   - Periodically audit recurring meetings to see if they can be canceled, merged, or reduced in frequency
   - Consider tools like [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/ai) for intelligent meeting scheduling and optimization

Avoid ghost strategies in times of critical or urgent activity. Avoid ghosting with external stakeholders and others that don't understand your operating behavior and intent. Professional ghosting is distinct from malicious ghosting exactly because your team understands and supports what you are doing, which is eliminating easy access in order to achieve focus. Your team should also have a way to break through this barrier and access you in a crisis situation. Here are a few options for such a ghost-busting escalation procedure:

1. Use a tool like PagerDuty
2. Remain responsive to direct messages, despite marking yourself away
3. Enable your manager to call or text your cell phone directly
