Ladderly.io provides five core benefits to free members, including two benefits that are also available to site guests.

## What is the Difference Between a Guest and a Free-Tier Member?

A free member is an individual that has signed up at Ladderly.io and logged in, in contrast to a free guest who is someone that visits the website without logging in.

## Guest Benefits

The blog includes a mix of free and premium articles. Free articles are available to all website visitors, including guests.

The second benefit is the community Discord server, which can be joined from the Community dropdown in the site navigation. Since you're here, you can also just [click this link](https://discord.com/invite/fAg6Xa4uxc)!

## Free-Tier Membership Benefits

1. Access to our Standard Checklist, which gives step-by-step and evidence-based instructions for breaking into tech and landing your first or next programming role.
2. The ability to create a [public community profile](https://www.ladderly.io/community), offer services, provide networking reasons, and indicate that you are open to work. Recruiters often browse our [directory of profiles](https://www.ladderly.io/community).
