The purpose of this guide is to maximize the performance of your job search as a software engineer.

This list was originally built on insights from a [data analysis by John Vandivier of 75+ job boards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wof3HPOLnPo&list=PL4hsXTgWARMzFezKkj7vGJKmtX0ugC49t). It has since been continuously updated for various reasons visible [here](https://github.com/Vandivier/ladderly-3/commits/main/ladderly-io/src/app/blog/2023-12-01-top-job-boards.md) in the GitHub file changelog.

### The Methodology: Optimizing the Job Search

John's approach focuses on job boards that offer one-click or easy apply options, as well as bulk apply features. These criteria are designed to maximize a candidate's efficiency and exposure to potential employers.

Remember to apply with social neworking. Applying without social networking constitutes a [low-effort application which can reduce your application to interview ratio by 30x](https://www.ladderly.io/blog/2024-08-04-no-cover-letters#an-original-contribution-of-data)!

### The Top Recommended Job Boards

1. [**LinkedIn Jobs**](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/): Offers easy apply and optional premium features for increased visibility.
2. [**Indeed**](https://www.indeed.com/): Easy apply available with additional services for resume optimization.
3. [**Interviewing.io**](https://interviewing.io/): Offers bulk apply and optional career coaching services.

2. [**Simplify.jobs**](https://simplify.jobs/): Another tool to use AI to rapidly search for jobs and apply to them.

### Qualified Job Titles

Note that many job titles have spelling variants. Consult Google Trends to select the recommended variant for your resume, LinkedIn Profile, and other written communication using an SEO mindset.

Ladderly recommends consulting the Google Trends 12 month view. In this view, for instance, [we currently see](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=fullstack%20developer,full%20stack%20developer,full-stack%20developer&hl=en) that Fullstack Developer is a preferred spelling to Full-Stack Developer.

Job Titles include:

1. Frontend Developer
2. Backend Developer
3. Fullstack Developer
4. UI Developer, UX Developer, and/or UI/UX Developer
5. Software Developer
6. Web Developer or Web Application Developer
7. JavaScript Developer
8. TypeScript Developer
9. React Developer
10. Angular Developer
11. Vue Developer
12. App Developer or Application Developer
13. Junior Developer
14. Sales Engineer

In all of these titles, you can also search for "Engineer" in addition to "Developer".

In addition to searching by title, you can also search by skillset. Here is [a prepared Indeed.com search](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=HTML+OR+CSS+OR+JAVASCRIPT+OR+TYPESCRIPT+OR+SQL+OR+REACT+OR+VUE+OR+ANGULAR&l=United+States) for the following skills:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. TypeScript
5. SQL
6. React
7. Vue
8. Angular

As you add skills, you can qualify for additional titles. After learning fullstack basics through [the Big 4 Projects](https://www.ladderly.io/blog/2023-10-01-quality-course-and-projects#the-big-4-projects), Ladderly recommends learning Python. Here are some other titles you can qualify for once SQL and Python are added to your skillset:

1. AI Engineer
2. AI Trainer
3. Applied Scientist
4. Business Analyst
5. Data Analyst
6. Data Engineer
7. Data Scientist
8. Database Administrator
9. Database Architect
10. Machine Learning Engineer
11. Member of Technical Staff
12. Python Developer
13. Research Scientist

Here are some other specializations that you can learn beyond fullstack basics and Python:

1. Cyber Security / Cybersecurity and InfoSec
2. DevOps
3. Testing
4. SEO
5. Accessibility / Section 508
6. Data Visualization
7. Backend Development
8. Mobile Development
9. Learning Other Languages

### Final Thoughts

Ladderly.io recommends using the above-specified job boards and tools to to quickly access a large number of relevant job opportunities. Ladderly recommends continuous skill development concurrent with the job search.

Ladderly recommends applying to 100 positions per week as a starting point in order to enable statistical measurement of your job search performance. Once interviews begin taking up your time, you can reduce the number of applications you submit. You can also reduce the number of applications you submit if you are only passively looking and/or being highly selective.
