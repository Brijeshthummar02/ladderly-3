Behavioral interviews are a standard component of hiring at every tier of the programming industry. These rounds are often formally declared, but this style of question is common even in recruiter screens and casual interviews.

Preparing answers for this type of interview also has external benefits into your social networking and on the job performance because:

1. Communication skill and influence have impact on the job. Fluent storytelling, particularly when paired with concrete examples and metrics, are powerful tools in design conversations and for continuous influence growth as you deliver and seek recognition for achievement on the job.
2. These sorts of anecdotes are great material for interpersonal networking outside of the job, at events, for online communication, and in day-to-day conversations when people simply ask about your work and career.
3. This material can solidify and empower your professional brand growth and social media content creation.

It is also important to note that a high-quality resume is aligned to these same stories of achievement. From a natural language perspective, a list of well-crafted behavioral interview stories can be directly distilled into a resume.

Amazon provides the industry-standard advice which is to use the STAR method, which stands for the following:

1. Situation
2. Task
3. Action
4. Result

Besides this standard advice, Amazon also evaluates candidates according to certain Amazon-specific behavioral and cultural values which they call the Leadership Principles. Unfortunately, there is no forcing function intrinisic to the STAR method which assures solving for the Leadership Principles, or for behavioral, cultural, and value signals more generally. Ladderly's `Advanced Behavioral Strategy` specifically solves this pain point and a few others, leading to highly differentiated behavioral interview performance for our members.

Meta provides a similar approach with a focus on the key pain point solved or obstacle resolved, using the SOAR acronym:

1. Situation
2. Obstacle
3. Action
4. Result

## Advanced Behavioral Strategy

Ladderly.io's `Advanced Behavioral Strategy` involves merging the STAR and SOAR methods then adding four components:

1. Explicit Signals
2. Reflection
3. Tactical Usage
4. Tactical Preperation

So, a list of stories following Ladderly.io's format will use the acronym STOARR:

1. Situation
2. Task
3. Obstacle
4. Action
5. Result
6. Reflection

## Story Generation

Ladderly.io recommends creating a [Google Doc](https://docs.new) to track your stories.

While on the job, story material is generated every sprint. It is a good practice to keep a Brag Sheet or a running document of accomplishments. You can also query your project management software for tasks completed, consult notes from meetings, and even search the codebase for changes you made to mine stories retrospectively if you have forgotten.

Some pain points occur when you haven't been at a company for a while. Here are a few strategies to mine stories in this case:

1. Don't worry about weekly or monthly accomplishments. Simply try to recall one story per quarter.
2. Contact a prior coworker to see if they are open to a chat which might jog your memory or if they would even be willing to query project management software or version control for you.
3. Leverage ballparking to establish impact. Estimating measures is fine when you no longer have access to exact data. This technique is developed in detail in blog article `22. Ballparking in the Job Search`.

Even if you have professional experience, you may benefit from creating even more stories outside of this professional experience.

### Without Professional Experience

If you have zero professional programming experience, derive stories from:

1. Open source projects
2. Non-programming employment
3. School projects

Ladderly.io recommends building a list of 5-10 stories, then sorting them by impact and biasing towards telling the most impactful stories in the interview. A candidate might like to tell the story which most directly answers the question, but an advanced technique is to redirect to a story with high impact even if it is not the most directly related. Like much of the behavioral interview, this verbal technique becomes easier with practice.

You should still ensure you answer the question, but you shouldn't constrain yourself to always pick the most direct answer to the question when another story is still good enough and does a much better job of showcasing your scope, skill, and impact.

Start by creating a baseline list of 5 stories and add additional stories as they come up over time with impact better than the weakest item on your list. No story is too small! Even with zero professional experience you can come up with 5 or more stories in the course of a month by building projects with proper instrumentation and capturing metrics.

### 10 Example Metrics

Here is a list of achievements, some small, some large, but the point is to start by creating aas:

1. Improved latency or speed (offline tasks like build time count!)
2. Improved website traffic
3. Improved test coverage
4. Simplified components (by component count, lines of code)
5. Generated revenue
6. Generated revenue drivers (even just social media views and followers!)
7. Reduced cost
8. Improved accuracy
9. Saved time
10. Improved satisfaction (of users, fellow contributors, or any stakeholder)

## Tactical Preperation

After constructing a list of STOARR anecdotes, prepare for company interviews with two steps. Research the company and obtaining a list of engineering and cultural values at the company. With a bit of research or by asking current employees, you may even be able to access the official leveling matrix at the company!

The second step is to practice the behavioral interview. You can also leverage the snowball method for the job search, so that real interviews at less-preferred companies act as preparation for preferred companies. Not only does this improve your interview performance through repitition, it may also generate an offer which can allow you to negotiate higher compensation, prevent lowballing, and generate confidence through demonstrated success.

It is important to have a degree of practice where you speak the solutions out loud. Here are some approaches to practice, in increasing order of utility:

1. Flashcard-style LLM Practice: Provide the LLM context on the company and ask it to give you behavioral interview questions. Don't walk through the whole story, but simply practice matching quickly to the story that you would tell.
2. Shadow interviews with an LLM. Provide an LLM the context for the company and ask it to give you behavioral interviews, acting as an interviewer. Use voice mode to speak out your full answer. Practice omitting filler words. At the end, ask it to grade your answer on a scale from 1 to 10 and provide feedback on what to do better.
3. Practice interview with a real programmer
4. Practice interview with a programmer that has experience conducting interviews at your target company. Interviewing.io is a great resource for FAANG interview preperation in this regard.

## Tactical Usage

Preperation is concerned with actions before the interview round. For this section on tactical STOARR anecdote usage, imagine that you are already in an interview round.

1. When receiving a question, first pause to show the interviewer that you are thinking. It's fine to take several seconds to think. Then smile and introduce the situation.

2. To comfortably introduce the situation, use a standard template:

   1. Standard prefix: "When I think about this question and my experience, I think a great story to tell is..."
   2. Introduce the year, quarter, company, team, and project title: "from 2022 in Q3, when I was working at Capital One. I was working in the CreditWise team on the COVID Information Rollout Project."
   3. Optionally give an overview of the scope and size of the company and team: "At this time, the CreditWise application had about 30 million monthly active users."

3. Now describe the task that you were supposed to complete and emphasize the pain point of an obstacle encountered.

   1. Emphasize why this task is considered difficult and important. Besides the metrics, we want to create an emotionally engaging story.
   2. Unexpected wrinkles and urgent deadlines are examples of sources of pain and frustration that might complicate an otherwise straightforward task and make the story more emotionally engaging and relatable to the interviewer, triggering empathy and helping them understand the impact of your action.

4. Now describe the action(s) you took to solve the problem.
   1. Sometimes an action leads to a wrinkle. Mentioning one of these is fine but it's not necessary to review multiple complications. You can simply mention if there were more and they can dive deeper during follow-up questions.
   2. Try to get through your story including reflection in 3 minutes, leaving time for follow-up questions.
5. Describe the result including SMART metrics.
6. Add a reflection step:

   1. "With the benefit of hindsight, one thing I would have done differently is..."
   2. Finish with a positive affirmation of a relevant signal. "Overall, I like this story because I think it demonstrates my ability to handle complex but impactful UI changes under a tight deadline."

<!-- TODO: complete below -->

Now that you have a list of STOARR anecdotes, how should you go about using one in a particular interview?

7. Prepare specifically for every final round by gathering information about the engineering values of the company you are applying at.
   Listen for queues that a question is behavioral. A common prefix to this kind of question is "Tell me about a time..."
8. When asked a q

explicit signals and a reflection step:

1. Directly map each story to generic engineering qualities

Add a reflection step after declaring the result 2. Map
